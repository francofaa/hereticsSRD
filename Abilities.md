# Abilities
There are four abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Willpower. They each have 2 scores, bonus and defense. The defense is equal to 10 + bonus of that score. For example, a strength bonus of 2 would yield a strength defense of 12.

Each ability has **static** stats, **actions**, and **saves** associated with them. 

Ability scores are capped at +10/def 20.

The abilities are paired in two ways: Strength and Dexterity are the physical abilities; Intelligence and Willpower the mental abilities. Strength and Intelligence are the active abilities; Dexterity and Willpower the defensive abilities. 

## Strength
*Power, heartiness, physicality*

### Static
- **Maximum load**, equal to strength defense

### Actions
- Attacks that are powerful or obvious 
- Feats of strength
- Brawling
- Recovery during short rests
- Shoving

### Saves

## Dexterity
*Finesse, movement, reflexes*

### Static 
- **Armored defense**, equal to dexterity defense plus any armor, or equal to armor only 
- **Movement**
   - All characters start with 40' of combat movement and 120' of exploration movement. Any penalties to dex reduce movement, 5 feet per bonus point.

#### Armored Defense 
Armored defense represents your ability to avoid damage via reflexes, dodging, or just actual armor. It is equal to your dexterity defense and may be modified by light armor, shields, and helmets or replaced entirely by heavy armor (which can still be modified by shields and helmets).

**Optional rule: Role to defend.** Rather than the referee rolling to attack a character's armor defense, the character may roll 1d20 + their armor bonus (*armored defense - 10*) against the defense stat the attacker is using to attack with.

### Actions

- Stunts
   - Extinguishing fire

## Willpower
*Charisma, luck, mental resilience*

### Static 
- **Magicked defense**, equal to willpower defense plus any wards
- **Maximum attuned magic items**, equal to willpower bonus (minimum 0)
- **Maximum retainers**, in hit dice, equal to willpower bonus (minimum 0)

#### Magicked Defense
Magicked defense represents your ability to resist spell damage and effects via sheer willpower, blessings, or luck. It is equal to your willpower defense and may be modified by wards.

**Optional rule: Roll to defend.** Rather than the referee rolling to attack a character's magicked defense, the character may roll 1d20 + their magicked bonus (*magicked defense - 10*) against the defense stat the attacker is using to cast with.
