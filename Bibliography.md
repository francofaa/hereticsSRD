# Bibliography

*Heretics* is a cobbled-together game in the folk tradition of homebrew gaming tables with various ideas, mechanics, and philosophies borrowed (looted) from treacherous delves into blogs, forums, chat groups, adventures, and systems. A complete catalogue of those would be impossible due to the ephemeral nature of memory and due to the litigious natures of certain organizations who don't even like to be mentioned. But those I have remembered are listed below:

## What's Different?

If you want to get technical, *Heretics* is inspired mostly by *Knave* and adds *Goblin Laws of Gaming* magic dice, fewer ability scores, and feats added in for class-like advancement. For people with RPGs that they already like and prefer playing, I hope you can cannibalize the following somewhat more novel material: 

- Tables for creating a patron deity (called "[Source](Source)").
- Tables for generating [mishaps and doom tables](MishapsandDooms) based on your Source rather than your magic-user class (because this game is classless).
- Feat-based progression to promote specialization (called "[Boons](Boons)") sorted by warrior, expert, mage, and zealot. 
- An [omens](Damage) mechanic which combines death and dismemberment by damage with ticking clock death, making the game slightly less deadly but slightly more dismembery.
- Omens that interact with boons.
- Special maneuvers that trigger on a 20+ based on [weapon types](MartialGear#Tags) (similar to *DCC*, but it's tied to the weapon).
- Tables for [medicinals](Medicinals) which act like cleric spells and their [components](wildernesswatch#Components).
- A [d100 spells](d100spells) table with a table of [weird locations](d100spells#spell-origins) you found the spells. 
- Tables for weird [Wards](magicalitems#wards) and [Focuses](magicalitems#focuses) and the weird ways you got them.

## What's the Same?

As for the opinions this game has, this heartbreaker 

- Rolls over for every type of check (not under or between) (5e)
- Saves using ability scores (not unified or unique by class and level) (5e)
- Has just four ability scores rather than the traditional 6, set up in 2 dyads: 2 mental, 2 physical; 2 forceful, 2 graceful (Arcane Ugly, DIY & Dragons)
- Proceduralizes combat, exploration (dungeon and wilderness), and downtime activities (Necropraxis, Errant, OSE, On Dungeons and Demesnes)
- Features the lockpicking procedure (not a skill test) (Errant, Telecanter)
- Unifies hit protection (not split into flesh and grit, nor does it roll over into a stat) (Pathfinder, 4e, 5e, OSE)
- Features slot-based inventory (not weight) (Knave)
- Randomizes character generation (Knave, Stars Without Number)
- Features level-less spells (Knave)
- Casts spells using magic dice (Goblin Laws of Gaming)
- Allows for retirement (Ironsworn)
- Features supply (Five Torches Deep)
- Advances characters using boons like class advancements (Pathfinder)
- Randomly generates factions and proceduralizes faction play (Mausritter, Dungeonfruit, Stars without Number)
- Kills less and dismembers more, and by damage type (though not based on amount of damage taken) (Emmy Allen)
- Counts omens every time a heretic hits zero HP and forces a roll to provide a ticking clock death mechanic (level2janitor)
- Abstracts distances (Monster of the Week, ICRPG)
