# Boons
Every even level (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), a heretic is granted a boon by their [Source](Source). Alternatively, the heretic may choose to take **grace**.

At every odd level starting with 3 (3, 5, 7, 9), you may swap a boon with another or barter a boon to receive **grace**.

Boons may be invented with collaboration of the referee or chosen from the tables below. Boons may also be banned at the referee's discretion or at a player's request. If any appear unbalanced, please contact [Root Devil](rootdevil.itch.io/) (opens external link).

## Grace

Taking grace resets any ability score to +0/10 def. Grace may not be bartered with. Once it is taken, it is considered expended. Grace may be taken in lieu of a boon at an even level or may be bartered for by giving up a boon at an odd level.

| Armored Defense         | Protector            | When an ally is hit by a weapon attack (ranged or melee) within 10 feet of you and you are wielding a shield, you may choose to take the damage for them. If the attack roll would not hit you, you suffer half damage instead.                                                                         |
| Armored Defense         | Dual-Wielder         | When you attack with a weapon with the dual-wield property, you roll damage at advantage (roll 2 weapon dice and take the higher). You have a +1 to armored defense (treat off-hand weapon as a +1 shield).                                                                                             |
| Armored Defense, Attack | Pugilist             | Your bare hands count as a d6 weapon and a shield as long as you are not wielding a weapon and shield.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Attack                  | Bloodlust            | When you take damage in a fight, you have a +1 bonus to attack until the fight is over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Attack                  | Butcher              | When you kill an enemy, you may immediately make another attack, even if the attack was triggered by this ability.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Attack                  | Great Weapon Fighter | When you roll damage while wielding a two-handed weapon, you may re-roll any result lower than 3. You must use the new roll, even if it is less than 3.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Attack                  | Improved Critical    | You score a critical hit on 19 as well as 20. Weapon tags are triggered on a 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Attack                  | Battle Master        | When you hit with a weapon attack and roll a 20+, you may perform a stunt (which succeeds automatically but is adjudicated by the referee) rather than trigger the weapon's tag.                                                                                                                        |
| Dexterity               | Duelist              | A number of times equal to your +dex bonus per day, you may reduce 1d12 incoming damage from a melee or ranged weapon attack you can see as long as you are wielding a melee weapon.                                                                                                                    |
| Dexterity               | Ambusher             | You have an ambush dice pool (d6) equal to your +dex bonus. When you hit on a weapon attack that either has advantage or is on a target in melee with an ally, you inflict any number of your ambush dice in additional damage of that weapon type. The dice used are expended and return at dawn.      |
| Dexterity               | Unarmored Fighter    | When you fight without armor, you may add your dexterity bonus to your damage rolls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Dexterity, Attack       | Dead Eye             | A number of times equal to your +dex bonus per day, you gain advantage on a shot with a ranged weapon. This attack ignores cover and does not take a penalty at the far range.                                                                                                                          |
| Dexterity, Attack       | Sharpshooter         | When you miss a ranged attack, you may re-roll. You must accept the new roll. You may do this a number of times per day equal to your +dex bonus.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Dexterity, Attack       | Dancing Warrior      | A number of times equal to your +dex bonus per day, you may make two melee weapon attacks during a combat round.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Intelligence            | Precision Striker    | When you make a melee weapon attack, you can add your +int bonus to the damage roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Omens                   | Berserker            | All of your weapon attacks inflict additional damage equal to your omens. When you are reduced to 0 HP, you attack at advantage rather than at disadvantage.                                                                                                                                            |
| Strength, Attack        | Shield Basher        | When wielding a shield, you may make a second attack each round using the shield as a free action. If the attack is successful, deal damage equal to your +str bonus and you have advantage on your next attack against that enemy. You may do this a number of times per day equal to your +str bonus. |

| Magic Dice                 | Safe Caster   | Once per day, you may treat 1 magic die result as a 1 (but keep the *sum*) of the actual result. This can avoid doubles and triples in addition to returning any dice to the pool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Magic Dice                 | Power Caster  | Once per day, you may change 1 magic die to a 6, modifying the *sum*. This also negates doubles and triples and expends the die from the pool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Magic Dice                 | Chaos Caster  | You no longer lose dice from your pool on 4-6. Instead, every time you cast a spell, add 1 chaos die to your pool. Differentiate these dice somehow. When you cast a spell, roll the chaos dice in addition to your Magic Dice. These dice do not contribute to *sum* or *dice*, but can contribute to mishaps and dooms. You are immune to mishaps on 1-3. Chaos dice expire at dawn. You are severed from any covens. |
| Magic Dice, Hit Protection | Bloodweaver   | Once per day, you may spend one turn (10 minutes) to inflict up to your +int bonus in HP on yourself to gain that many magic dice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Magic Dice, Omens          | Omen Caster   | You have magic dice equal to your omens. You are severed from any covens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Spells                     | Quick Caster  | Designate three spells. These can be accessed as though they were in a quick slot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Spells                     | War Caster    | You may cast spells with one hand, freeing another to wield a weapon or shield                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Spells, Intelligence       | Spell Bubbles | You gain a number of bubbles equal to your +int score. When you cast an area of effect spell, you can put objects and people in them to protect them from the spell. You can only do this for spells that you cast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
