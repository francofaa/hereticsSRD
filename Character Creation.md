# Character Creation
1. Choose or randomly assign your [ability scores](/abilities) (strength, dexterity, intelligence, willpower) by adding 3 points and subtracting 1 point in any combination.
2. Roll for your [grit (hit protection) and flesh (wounds)](/damage) by rolling 1d8, 1d8 rerolling 1's and 2's, or rolling 2d4. Determine your secondary stats based on your ability scores.
3. Choose or roll 1d6 by 1d8 for [2 backgrounds](#3-background-starting-gear) and receive the starting [equipment](/items) for both backgrounds. 
4. Choose or roll *n*d20 for adventuring equipment up to your maximum inventory load (equal to your strength defense).
5. Choose or roll for your [character traits and relationships](#5-traits) by rolling all of your dice at once (1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 2d10, 1d12, and 1d20). 
6. Choose or roll for [name](/namestables)

These steps are described in more detail below. 

For character sheets:
- Short version (4 to a page): [heretics_playerSheets_0-1-4-to-page.pdf](/heretics_playerSheets_0-1-4-to-page.pdf)
- Long version (1 to a page): [heretics_playerSheets_0-1-single-page.pdf](/heretics_playerSheets_0-1-single-page.pdf)
- Google Spreadsheet (make a copy): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19pv8S7_A3jCTb1wBprDFFxTAvuviTkqlpf4fHKd4JQE/edit#gid=0

**Optional rule: Starting at level 0**
1. Roll 1d8 for your flesh points. You have 0 grit.
2. Your stats all start at 0 bonus / 10 defense. 
3. You start with 2 days' worth of rations, 2 torches, and 1 weapon of your choice. 
4. Choose or roll for one background
5. When you advance to level 1 after acquiring 100 XP, determine ability scores as above. Additionally, roll 1d8 for your grit and add 1 to your flesh.

## 1. Determining Abilities 
Character abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Willpower. All of your ability bonuses start at 0. Distribute 3 ability points to your abilities and then subtract 1 point from your abilities. Add 10 to get that ability's defense. For example, a strength bonus of +1 is a strength defense of 11. 

**Optional rule: Random ability scores.** This can also be done randomly by rolling 4d4, adding 1 for the first three rolls and subtracting one for the last roll, determining which stat is increased/decreased by assigning the numbers one through four, in order, to Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Willpower. You may then swap 2 ability bonus scores. 

For example: The first d4 lands on a 3, so Intelligence is increased by 1. The second lands on a 4, so Willpower increases by 1. The third lands on 3 again, so Intelligence is increased by 1. The last lands on 1, so Strength is *decreased* by 1.

Possible arrays starting, not taking into account position of stats, are as follows.

1. 3, 0, 0, -1
2. 2, 0, 0, 0
3. 1, 1, 0, 0
4. 1, 1, 1, -1

## 2. Determining Secondary Stats

### Hit Protection
Hit protection is split into grit and flesh. Roll 1d8 to find your grit total. Subtract your grit from 9 to get your flesh total. 

**Optional rule: Friendlier HP.** You may also roll 1d8 rerolling 1's and 2's or 2d4 to determine the initial grit.

### Derived Stats
Your secondary stats are determined as follows:
   - Max Load = Strength defense
   - Armored defense = Dexterity defense, plus any armor
   - Movement is by default equal to 40 / 120
   - Max Supply = intelligence defense
   - Mana Dice = intelligence bonus + 1
   - Magicked defense = willpower defense, plus any wards
   - Max Attuned items = willpower bonus 
   - Max Retainers = willpower bonus

## 3. Background Starting Gear
You start with 2 backgrounds which inform what you start with on your person. Roll 1d8 and 1d6 and cross reference the numbers to find your background. Roll the two dice again to get your second background. These are failed professions that you endeavored before becoming an adventurer, so treat them as such. 

You get the gear from each background.

Actions performed using skills or tools relevant to a character's background are done at advantage.

**Optional rule: Species traits.** The characters are assumed to be human; however, if the referee allows other non-human species in the game, the player may replace one of the background traits with abilities from their species. Other traits can be created in cooperation with the referee. The referee has final say if the species are appropriate to the setting: 
- **Stone cunning**: You gain tremor sense for *L* x 10 minutes once per day
- **Hearth born**: You are immune to fire
- **Burrower**: You can dig superhumanly fast
- **Spiderclimb**: Your hands and feet stick to walls

## Reading a Stat Line
All creatures can be expressed in a single stat line. 

1. L# or \#HD: Indicates level for a player character or retainer / hit dice for monsters
2. HP #(#): Indicates hit points. Parenthetical number represents flesh points, if any.
3. AD # (*armor, if applicable*): Armored Defense stat, followed by any modifying armor pieces
4. MD # (*wards, if applicable*): Magicked Defense stat followed by any modifying wards. 
5. STR # DEX # INT # WIL #: The four ability in a row. Only lists the bonus. Add 10 to get the defense. When a stat line omits the ability, assume that its bonus is 0. 
6. MV # (#): Movement, in feet. The first number is exploration (10 minutes in a dungeon), second number combat movement (10 seconds). Usually omitted if it is 120 (40).
7. Att: Attacks, usually followed by a to-hit bonus, a die (damage), and a parenthetical indicating the weapon, or spell. 
8. Items: List of all items that the creature carries. 
9. *Special ability*: Any additional abilities. [Knacks](/xp#knacks) can appear here. Monsters have their abilities here as well. 

**Example:** 

Ogden Dankworth. L2. HP 13(7). AD 13 (shield, helmet). MD 11. STR 2 DEX 1 INT 1. Att 1 x 1d6 (short sword). Items: crowbar, rope, short sword 1d6, shield ad+1, helmet ad+1, fireball (spellbook), ward md+1. Butcher: When you kill an enemy, you may immediately make another attack
