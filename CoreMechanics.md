# Core Rules

The referee describes the world and the heretics (the player characters) interact with it. When something is in doubt, the players must make checks. When an activity is performed over a period of time, procedures may be followed to resolve that activity. 

## Checks

To make a check, the player rolls a d20 and adds their character's relevant ability modifier. If the roll is equal or over the target difficulty class (DC), then the check succeeds and the character does what they meant to do (or as close as they could reasonably come to it). The referee will also roll for non-player characters by rolling a d20 and adding a relevant modifier. A natural 20 always succeeds. A natural 1 always fails. 

Failure should be more interesting than just "you don't do it," and could even be "you do it but something awful happens."

## Procedures

A procedure is a list of steps to follow to resolve something. Combat, for example, starts with initiative and continues with alternating attacks until one side is wiped out or retreats. 

It's recommended to follow these procedures to simplify travel, combat, and exploration and to establish parameters of play for the group and define consequences. All of these procedures can be thrown out or modified.

The time-based procedures are 

- [Combats](combatround)
- [Dungeon exploration](dungeonturn)
- [Wilderness exploration and travel](wildernesswatch)
- [Downtime activities](downtimecycle)

The mechanical procedures are

- [Dueling procedures](duelingbeats)
- [Lockpicking](Lockpicking)
- [Research and crafting](researchandcrafting)
- [Robberies and heists](robberiesandheists)

## Abstracted Measurements

Generally, the procedures and items in this document abstract measurements. 

### Time

- Rounds: The amount of time it takes to attack and move around in combat 
- Turns: The amount of time it takes to move through a few rooms or explore one in great detail
- Watches: The amount of time it takes to travel double the distance to a point on the horizon
- Cycle: The amount of time it takes to do a project or two and get some rest and relaxation

### Weight

Things that are heavy take up 2 or more slots. Full plate armor, for example, a very heavy item, takes up 4.

### Distance

Distance is measured in zones. 

- **Close:** If you are in a zone with someone, you are **close**. If you are targeted by or if you attempt a melee attack, you are in **melee**. 
- **Nearby:** If you are 1 zone away, you are **nearby**. You can call over to creatures in zones that are nearby. You can get there in a round and still do something. 
- **Far:** If you are 2 zones away, you are **far.** You can still see the whites of someone's eyes. You can get there in a round but you can't do much else. 
- **Out of range:** If you are 3 zones away, you are **out of range.** You can make out the shape of someone. You can't get there in a round, but you can still see your target.

Heretics can move nearby (1 zone at a time) and far (2 zones) if using their action to move again. 

If using a grid map, the distances below are from the origin:

- **Close:** 1-2 units (5-10 feet)
- **Nearby:** 5-8 units (25-40 feet)
- **Far**: 12-18 units (60-90 feet)
- **Out of range:** 24+ units (120+ feet)

On average, a zone is about 8 units or 40 feet.
