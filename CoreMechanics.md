# Core Rules

The referee describes the world and the player characters interact with it. When something is in doubt, the characters must make checks. When an activity is performed over a period of time, procedures may be followed to resolve that activity. 

## Checks

To make a check, the player rolls a d20 and adds their character's relevant ability modifier. If the roll is equal or over the target difficulty class (DC), then the check succeeds and the character does what they meant to do (or as close as they could reasonably come to it). A natural 20 always succeeds. A natural 1 always fails. 

Failure should be more interesting than just "you don't do it," and could even be "you do it but something awful happens."

## Procedures

A procedure is a list of steps to follow to resolve something. Combat, for example, starts with initiative and continues with alternating attacks until one side is wiped out or routed. 

It's recommended to follow these procedures to simplify travel, combat, and exploration and to establish parameters of play for the group and define consequences. All of these procedures can be thrown out, but the referee would then be left to make adjudications completely by fiat. 

The main procedures are 

- [Combats](combatround)
- [Wilderness exploration and travel](wildernesswatch)
- [Dungeon exploration](dungeonturn)

Optional procedures include 

- [Downtime activities](downtimecycle)
- [Dueling procedures](duelingbeats)
- [Lockpicking](Lockpicking)
