# Damage
When a character suffers damage, they may take grit or flesh damage. 

Grit represents to the character near misses, stunning blows, stamina depletion, superficial wounds and bruises, and so on. Once grit is depleted, the character will begin suffering damage to flesh and suffer negative effects from this damage going untreated.

Flesh represents deep wounds, broken bones, internal and external bleeding, and so on. Any attacks done directly to flesh points can be debilitating and should be described as such by the referee. Once flesh is depleted, the character will fall into semi-consciousness. Any subsequent damage will kill the character. 

## Direct Damage
Some damage may bypass grit. Some damage may also outright kill a character. 

### NPC HP
Non-player characters do not distinguish between flesh and grit. Any direct damage instead inflicts triple the damage dice.

### Environmental

All of the following environmental damage (*in its non-magical form*) is considered **direct damage**, bypassing grit: 
- Non-magical fire, 1d6 direct damage
- On fire, 2d6 direct damage per round
- Lava, instant death
- Acid, 1d6 direct damage
- Drowning. Characters can hold their breath for 30 seconds (3 rounds of combat) per point of Strength bonus. After this point, they must make strength saving throws DC 15 every round or die. 
- Freezing water. Characters must make Strength saving throws DC 15 every minute or take 1 direct damage.
- Non-magical lightning, 3d6 direct damage
- Falling, 1d6 direct damage per 10 feet, to a maximum 10d6.
- Poison, direct damage (amount depends on the poison) 

### Ambush damage
If a character is ambushed, the damage is inflicted directly to the flesh points. The damage is the *normal weapon damage*. 

Characters when attacking in the same way *triple the damage dice* because NPCs do not have grit and flesh but one pool of hit protection.

## Death and Saving
Being reduced to 0 flesh points reduces your grit points to 0 (if not already reduced to 0) and requires stabilization within 1 minute or by the end of the combat, whichever is later, or the character dies.

If the character suffers damage while at 0 flesh, they die.

### Stabilization and Injury
An ally may try to stabilize the downed character by rolling an ability check, a spell, using herbs, or some other manner of healing. 

Once stabilized, the character rolls 1d20 on the permanent injury table: 

1. False hope: you're dead (1)
2. Lose a body part (2)
3. Feeble: lose 1d6 str (3-6)
4. Shaky: lose 1d6 dex (7-10)
5. Addled: lose 1d6 int (11-14)
6. Weak: lose 1d6 wil (15-18)
7. Disadvantage on all checks until rested (19)
8. Standing: Instantly heal to 1d8 grit (20)

Unless a 1 was rolled, the character heals to 1 flesh. 

#### Death 
When a character dies, write down their fate on the back of the character sheet. The character sheet may be ritualistically burned, buried, or sent off in a funeral boat later because the player should roll up another character (or ideally have another character waiting in the wings) to get back into the game.

#### Recovering from Injuries
The injuries feeble, shaky, addled, and weak may be removed after a number of weeks equal to the lowest result from rolling a number of d6 equal to character level. 

For example, a level 4 character rolls 4d6, resulting in a 3, 3, 5, and 6. The lowest number is 3, so the character's ability is restored after 3 weeks of rest. 

## Resting

A short rest takes 1 hour. 

A long rest takes 8 hours, 6 of which must be spent asleep. 

| Conditions                                 | Restored Grit | Restored Flesh |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------- | -------------- |
| Long rest in town or wilderness, with meal | 100%          | 1              |
| Wilderness, safe short rest                | L x d8 + str  | 0              |
| Short or long rest (with meal) in dungeon  | 1d8 + str     | 0              |

Long rests in a dungeon are inadvisable and are likely to fail. 

Resting must be safe and include food, drink, and (for long rests) sleep. Any interruption removes all benefits. The additional effects of ineffective resting follow: 

- **Hunger**. If characters do not eat in a day, they may not heal after their rests.
- **Sleep deprivation**. After a night of not sleeping, characters must roll at disadvantage until they rest. They do not heal from the rest. 
- **Thirst**. After one day of not drinking, characters must roll at disadvantage until they drink.  They do not heal from the rest. After three days, they must make DC 15 strength saves every hour or die.
