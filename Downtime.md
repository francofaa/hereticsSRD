# Downtime

## Lifestyle
There are there levels of upkeep. These numbers should be used during downtime: 
1. Meager: 1 coin / day; 7 coins / week; 30 coins / month
2. Comfortable: L coins / day; L x 7 coins / week; L x 30 coins / month
3. Luxurious: L x 5 coins / day; L x 35 coins / week; L x 150 coins / month

Upkeep includes room and board, but also things like keeping your armor and weaponry clean, mending your socks, and feeding your horses.

## Magical Research
Inventing spells is dangerous. When working to invent a spell, spend 1,000 coins in research activities and resources, spend a week in time, acquire an object to house the spell, and roll +int against a DC 20. On a success, you create the spell with the referee and must cast it once using all of your mana dice. On a fail, roll all of your mana dice and make a +warded defense save against your int defense. On a success, any dooms and mishaps are negated. On a failure, they are not. 

## Mastercrafting 
You spend time with a master crafter to improve your weapons. Applying additional effects to weapons (such as silvering or gilding or reinforcing) costs coin to be adjudicated by the referee. 

## Brewing and Crafting
Inventing potions is dangerous. When working to invent a potion, spend 1,000 coins in research activities and resources, spend a week in time, and roll +int against a DC 20. On a success, you gain potions 5/5. On a failure, your brewing goes wrong and you suffer a mishap, adjudicated by the referee. 

## Socializing 

When socializing with people in the world during downtime, disposition can be determined with a 2d6 roll, unless it is already obvious for whatever reason: 

| 2d6   | Disposition  |
| ----- | ------------ |
| 2-3   | Hostile      |
| 4-5   | Unfriendly   |
| 6-8   | Uninterested |
| 9-10  | Polite       |
| 11-12 | Friendly     |
