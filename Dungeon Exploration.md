# Dungeon Exploration
Exploring a dungeon is done in turns. Each turn represents 10 minutes of exploration. 

Sequence of play per turn: 
1. **Wandering monsters**, if present, move through the dungeon.
2. **Actions**: The party decides what action to take, like moving, searching, listening, entering a room. 
3. **Description**: The referee describes what happens. If monsters are encountered, refer to the combat section. 
4. **End of turn**: Referee updates time records, with special attention to light sources, spell durations, and the party's need to rest. 

## 1 Wandering Monsters
Roll 1d6 every 2 turns in a dungeon. On a 6, the wandering monster appears 2d6 x 10 feet moving toward the party. 

## 2 Actions
The party decides what action to take, like moving, searching, listening, entering a room. 

Characters may search for 
- room traps (within a 10 x 10 area)
- secret doors (within a 10 x 10 area)
- treasure traps (on a specific object or location)

**Darkvision is not perfect:** Monochrome outlines of moving shapes in darkness. Dim light is **moonlight** and even modern infantry doesn't conduct operations at night. Anything for which **fine eyesight** is required will be difficult even with darkvision.

There is a 1/6 chance of finding these things. The roll is made in secret by the referee. 

There is a 2 in 6 chance that a trap is triggered when a character makes an action that could trigger the trap. 

Characters move at a rate of 3 times their base speed. So a character that moves 40 feet in a combat turn moves 120 feet in a dungeon turn, which represents slow careful movement.

Movement through already explored areas may be allowed at a faster rate. 

## 3 Description
Referee describes what happens. 

## 4 End of Turn
- **Time-keeping device:** Measure the amount of time they are in the dungeon. Use 1d6 where every activity is 10 minutes and every die is one hour. From 6 to 1, their **torches burns out**. Other taxing conditions can take effect (cold, heat, magical effects, etc)
- After 1 hour (6 dungeon turns), the characters **must rest for 1 turn** or will suffer disadvantage on attack rolls. 

Resting for 1 hour in the dungeon heals 1d8 + str bonus. Resting for 8 hours is not possible in a dungeon.

## Rolling to Return
Sometimes there is insufficient time to escape a dungeon to a safe location during a session. When it is necessary that a party be back in civilization or back at a camp, as may be during a Western Marches campaign, the characters may roll to return to a safe camp. 

The referee determines whether this is a dangerous or arduous journey.

DC = 10 + hour of travel, maximum of DC 20

On a success, the characters return to camp. 

On a failure, the characters pay a cost: 

- Dangerous: 1d6 damage is inflicted for every 1 under the DC
- Arduous: lose 1 load of equipment per 1 under the DC

If a character is reduced to 0 flesh, they die or are left unconscious, suffering all of the effects of being reduced to 0. The referee picks what load is dropped, starting with less valuable and less secure items, and working up to weapons and armor.
