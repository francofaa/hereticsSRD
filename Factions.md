# Factions

Factions are competing groups within an area, whether in the overworld or in a dungeon. 

## Creating Factions

Create factions one by one. Create a maximum of 5. When creating the next faction, determine how they interact with the previous faction(s) (as allies, rivals, or something in between) and with the player characters.

After, before, or during the generation of resources and goals for a faction, the referee (or the players and the referee) may determine the aesthetics, name, details, and hierarchy of the faction. 

> Note that it is not recommended that the players be aware of the goals of the factions since this should be information gathered during play.

### Resources

First, determine what resources the faction has. Choose or roll for 2-3 resources. 

1. Wealth
2. Network / logistics
3. Zealots
4. Arsenals
5. Secret hideout 
6. Political connections
7. Experts
8. Spies / informants
9. Assassins
10. Saboteurs
11. Food and water
12. Raw material resource
13. Domesticated animals
14. Land / property
15. Gangs
16. Respect / popularity
17. Debts (on others)
18. Intimidating presence
19. Arcane powers
20. Supernatural or monstrous powers

### Faction Goals

Choose or roll for one ultimate goal by combining 1d4 method and 1d4 target. 

| d4  | Method                      | Target         |
| --- | --------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1   | Create / Establish / Summon | System         |
| 2   | Control                     | Object         |
| 3   | Destroy / Kill              | Person / Group |
| 4   | Steal / Rob                 | Place          |

Once the ultimate goal is created, create 1-3 more goals that would lead up to that ultimate goal. The goals should be completed in order. 

> Goals are not means to an end. Money and power, for example, are not goals. They are means to a real goal. Goals should also be proactive, not reactive. Defending a vault of treasure is not a goal. Finally, goals should be self-serving and not strictly morally good or bad. 

Keep in mind that not all factions have sinister objectives and some may work with or against the player characters, or even shift alliances.

Once the first faction is created, consider ways the next 1-4 factions could interconnect. 

## Faction Progress

For each of the faction goals, there should be tally marks to mark progress, 2 for simple goals, up to 5 for more complex goals.

Between adventures, during a [downtime cycle](downtimecycle), factions will make moves. Roll 1d6. On a 4-5, mark 1 progress toward their current goal. On a 6, mark 2. 

Add bonuses or penalties depending on any 
- relevant resources
- rivals to that goal

Once a goal is achieved, the faction may add a resource relevant to the completion of the goal. If the goal impacts another faction, that faction should have a resource removed or changed, or a progress toward a relevant goal reduced.
