# Goons

Goons are any NPC that is hired by a character to perform certain tasks. Retainers are a specific subset that level like player characters and their number is limited to an employer's +wil bonus.

All morale checks for goons use the employer's +wil bonus. 

## Hirelings 

Any number of hirelings can be hired by any character. 

### Helpers

0HD. HP 1.

**Role**: Hauling treasure and equipment, bearing torches. 

**Avoids**: Taking part in anything dangerous, like fighting monsters and detecting traps. 

**Breaking points:** Any sign of danger whatsoever. 

**Wages**: 10 coins / day

### Experts

1HD. HP 2d4. INT 2. 

**Role:** Provide services within their area of expertise. 

**Breaking points**: Danger beyond what was originally expected of them. Half HP. Half of allies out.

**Wages:** 20-100 coins / day

### Mercenaries

**Archer.** 1HD. HP 2d4. AD 13 (helmet, mail). STR 2. Att 1 x 1d6 (bow).

## Retainers

Retainers are a subset of goons that follow their employer with loyalty.

**Sample stat line:** 1HD. HP 6. AD 13 (shield, helmet). WD 10. STR 1 DEX 1, INT 1. Att 1 x 1d6 (short sword) or 1 x spell. Items: Firebolt (spellbook).

A retainer's stats should be rolled ahead of time just like level 1 player character and populate the world. Retainers have no boons.

**Avoids:** Retainers will only follow player characters of a higher level than they are. Therefore level 1 characters cannot hire retainers. 

You can command retainers of HD up to your wil bonus. For example, a character with +2 wil may have one 2HD retainer or two 1HD retainers.

**Role:** Everything a player character does. 

**Wages:** Retainers earn a half share of experience and treasure and can gain levels over time.

**Breaking points:** Half HP. Half of allies out.

**Availability:** Retainers can be found in any settlement. 

### Retainer Maneuvers

Rather than take an action, a character may instead issue a command for their retainers to follow a specific order as a unit. Otherwise, retainers will fight to survive. 

To issue a command, a commander must make a +wil roll against a DC equal to the total HD of monsters in a combat (rounded up) or 10, whichever is higher.

On a failure the retainers will continue to fight to survive, but on a success, a character may order the retainers to perform specific coordinated tactics. This could include

- Charging
- Kiting
- Focus fire
- Cutting off escape
- Retreat
- Perform a stunt (like grabbing an item or passing items to characters)
- Forming a shield wall
