# Heretics, Player Guide

# Introduction

## Premise 

The characters are in a low magic world, secret followers of a heretical religion. 

## Principles

- **Danger is real.** Make a few characters to start with. Choosing combat is always the most dangerous option. 
- **Hit protection is not health. Health is health.** Your hit protection is divided into two: Grit and flesh. Flesh is your body, grit is your stamina, more or less. You can't swim across a pool of lava and quaff a health potion. Also, there are no health potions. Let's just get that out of the way.
- **Player ingenuity over character abilities.** As in real life, the only way to guarantee victory is with ingenuity, cunning, cleverness, planning, and overwhelming force. Luck is fickle and your modifiers aren't that good.
- **Magic is dangerous.** Mishaps will happen and dooms may occur. Spells are alive and live inside of objects. You can cast magic without artifacts and invent spells or magical effects on the fly but it's dangerous to be your own battery.
- **Level-less spells.** Spells are just spells and their power increases depending on how much power you imbue into it using mana dice.
- **No dump stats, no god stats.** There are only four ability scores (strength, dexterity, intelligence, and willpower) and they are set up in pairs (physical vs mental and offensive vs defensive). A spell-caster with high strength can carry more spell books, and a melee fighter with high willpower can command more retainers.
- **Your character is not the sheet.** If your ability score is low, it doesn't mean you have to roleplay it that way. It just means you have to prepare more to accommodate for the potential of failure. Avoid ever having to roll.
- **Offensive and defensive abilities.** You (almost) always attack with strength and intelligence and you have two static defense stats: Armored defense (dexterity modified by armor) and magicked defense (willpower modified by wards). Every ability has a defense and bonus and may require saves. And some situations may allow you to make physical attacks with intelligence or dexterity. 
- **But no classes, just inventory.** No classes means everyone can cast spells, swing swords, charm merchants, and walk across a tightrope. Knacks help characters specialize but ultimately, what you have is what you can do. And inventory management becomes important and is simplified with a slot mechanic. 
- **Travel and resources.** Journeying through the wilderness to get to the dungeon can be dangerous, and keeping fed will keep you alive and able to rest. 
- **Rounds, Turns, Watches.** Combat split into rounds with side-based initiative; dungeon exploration split into turns of 10 minutes to find traps, strategize, loot, investigate, and sneak; journeys split into 6 watches of 4 hours each for traveling, climbing, resting, foraging, and hunting.
- **Simpler monsters.** Monster stat blocks are stat lines, like in other OSR games and their difficulty level is determined by their hit dice (HD).
- **Failure.** Failure does not necessarily mean the character fails what they set out to do and should really never mean nothing happens. Because "nothing happens" is never the worst thing that could happen.
- **Play to find out what happens.** Let the players direct what they want to do. Be surprised and be their fan. Abide by the dice and roll out in the open, unless it would impact verisimilitude. 
- **The monsters know what they're doing.** The world is *real* and the creatures that inhabit it have their own desires and objectives. They may not always stand and fight to the death, they may be reasoned with, and they may try to conspire against (or with) the characters. 
- **Rulings over rules.** If at any time a rule is unclear or doesn't make sense or there is an argument over it, make a decision and move the game along, and put a pin in the rule and email me about it please. It's important to move the game along.
- **Move the game along.** Along with the above rule, also make sure that when a player character dies, that player has another character that can jump in quickly, even if it seems unlikely. Who cares. We all want to play and it sucks to sit on the sidelines for any amount of time. Whether it makes sense ("I was exploring this dungeon too!" "I've been looking everywhere for you!" "I was just a torch bearer but that PC's death made me gain a PC level and now I'm also here. Can I have their stuff?") or not ("I'm Hank's son, Hank 2, but just call me Hank"), just keep it moving. 

## Inspiration and Sources

To be fair, many of these games inspired each other, so I am only noting where I first encountered certain concepts:

- Arcane Ugly for mishaps and wands (and also a thanks for documenting the process of creating a TTRPG)
- Knave (this is mostly a hack of Knave)
- Goblin Laws of Gaming for mana dice and spells
- Five Torches Deep for supply, monster math, and charisma for retainers
- Cairn for spells
- Mausritter for inventory and spells as artifacts
- Stars Without Number for one-roll tables
- Maze Rats for name generators
- Apocalypse World and Monster of the Week for doomsday clocks, tags, and introducing me to playing to find out what happens
- DURF for being very similar to what I ended up making but only found toward the end of writing
- Ironsworn for retirement rules
- Old School Essentials for monster stats, generators, and dungeon exploration rules
- Morkborg for weird aesthetics, dungeons, and horrible artifacts 
- Ryuutama for travel rules
- The Monsters Know What They're Doing for general monster strategy
- Principia Apocrypha for principles 

This game is intended to be compatible with material written for OSR games. 

# Character Creation

1. Choose or roll your ability scores (bonuses and defenses) by adding 3 points and subtracting 1 point or rolling 1d4 in order to add or subtract each point and assigning a number to each of the abilities. 
2. Roll for your grit (hit protection) and flesh (wounds) by rolling 1d8, 1d8 rerolling 1's and 2's, or rolling 2d4. 
3. Choose or roll 1d6 by 1d8 for 2 backgrounds and receive the starting equipment for both backgrounds. 
4. Choose or roll *n*d20 for adventuring equipment up to your maximum inventory load (equal to your strength defense).
5. Choose or roll for your character traits and relationships by rolling 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 2d10, 1d12, and 1d20. 
6. Choose or roll for name

These steps are described in more detail below. 

**Optional rule: Starting at level 0**

1. Roll 1d8 for your flesh points. You have 0 grit.
2. Your stats all start at 0 bonus / 10 defense. 
3. You start with 2 days' worth of rations, 2 torches, and 1 weapon of your choice. 
4. Choose or roll for one background
5. When you advance to level 1 after acquiring 100 XP, roll for your stats as above. Additionally, roll 1d8 for your grit. 

## 1. Determining Abilities 

Character abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Willpower. All of your ability bonuses start at 0. Distribute 3 ability points to your abilities and then subtract 1 point from your abilities. Add 10 to get that ability's defense. For example, a strength bonus of +1 is a strength defense of 11. 

**Optional rule: Random ability scores.** This can also be done randomly by rolling 4d4, adding 1 for the first three rolls and subtracting one for the last roll, determining which stat is increased/decreased by assigning the numbers one through four, in order, to Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Willpower. You may then swap 2 ability bonus scores. 

For example: The first d4 lands on a 3, so Intelligence is increased by 1. The second lands on a 4, so Willpower increases by 1. The third lands on 3 again, so Intelligence is increased by 1. The last lands on 1, so Strength is *decreased* by 1.

Possible arrays starting, not taking into account position of stats, are as follows.

1. 3, 0, 0, -1
2. 2, 0, 0, 0
3. 1, 1, 0, 0
4. 1, 1, 1, -1

## 2. Determining Secondary Stats

### Hit Protection
Hit protection is split into grit and flesh. Roll 1d8 to find your grit total. Subtract your grit from 9 to get your flesh total. 

**Optional rule: Friendlier HP.** You may also roll 1d8 rerolling 1's and 2's or 2d4 to determine the initial grit.

### Derived Stats

Your secondary stats are determined as follows:

   - Max Load = Strength defense
   - Armored defense = Dexterity defense, plus any armor
   - Movement is by default equal to 40 / 120
   - Max Supply = intelligence defense
   - Mana Dice = intelligence bonus + 1
   - Magicked defense = willpower defense, plus any wards
   - Max Attuned items = willpower bonus 
   - Max Retainers = willpower bonus

## 3. Background Starting Gear

You start with 2 backgrounds which inform what you start with on your person. Roll 1d8 and 1d6 and cross reference the numbers to find your background. Roll the two dice again to get your second background. These are failed professions that you endeavored before becoming an adventurer, so treat them as such. 

You get the gear from each background.

Actions performed using skills or tools relevant to a character's background are done at advantage.

**Optional rule: Species traits.** The characters are assumed to be human; however, if the referee allows other non-human species in the game, the player may replace one of the background traits with abilities from their species. Other traits can be created in cooperation with the referee. The referee has final say if the species are appropriate to the setting:

Choose or roll for a name. 


## Reading a Stat Line

All creatures can be expressed in a single stat line. 

1. L# or \#HD: Indicates level for a player character or retainer / hit dice for monsters
2. HP #(#): Indicates hit points. Parenthetical number represents flesh points, if any.
3. AD # (*armor, if applicable*): Armored Defense stat, followed by any modifying armor pieces
4. MD # (*wards, if applicable*): Magicked Defense stat followed by any modifying wards. 
5. STR # DEX # INT # WIL #: The four ability in a row. Only lists the bonus. Add 10 to get the defense. When a stat line omits the ability, assume that its bonus is 0. 
6. MV # (#): Movement, in feet. The first number is exploration (10 minutes in a dungeon), second number combat movement (10 seconds). Usually omitted if it is 120 (40).
7. Att: Attacks, usually followed by a to-hit bonus, a die (damage), and a parenthetical indicating the weapon, or spell. 
8. Items: List of all items that the creature carries. 
9. *Special ability*: Any additional abilities. Knacks can appear here. Monsters have their abilities here as well. 

**Example:** 

Ogden Dankworth. L2. HP 13(7). AD 13 (shield, helmet). MD 11. STR 2 DEX 1 INT 1. Att 1 x 1d6 (short sword). Items: crowbar, rope, short sword 1d6, shield ad+1, helmet ad+1, fireball (spellbook), ward md+1. Butcher: When you kill an enemy, you may immediately make another attack

Mind Vampire. 5HD. AD 15. MD 15. Str 5, Int 7, Wil 5. Att 1 x +5 2d8 grappling, or disrupt psyche, or drink sapience. Disrupt Psyche: 30' radius, MD save 15 or incapacitated, 2 uses. Drink Sapience: atk + 5, 1 grappled target, drains -1d6 wil.



# Abilities

There are four abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Willpower. They each have 2 scores, bonus and defense. The defense is equal to 10 + bonus of that score. For example, a strength bonus of 2 would yield a strength defense of 12.

Each ability has **static** stats, **actions**, and **saves** associated with them. 

Ability scores are capped at +10/def 20.

The abilities are paired in two ways: Strength and Dexterity are the physical abilities; Intelligence and Willpower the mental abilities. Strength and Intelligence are the active abilities; Dexterity and Willpower the defensive abilities. 

## Strength

*Power, heartiness, physicality*

### Static

- **Maximum load**, equal to strength defense

### Actions

- Attacks that are powerful or obvious 
- Feats of strength
- Brawling

### Saves

- Poison
- Disease
- Escaping
- Enduring fatigue
- Non-magical paralysis

## Dexterity

*Finesse, movement, reflexes*

### Static 

- **Armored defense**, equal to dexterity defense plus any armor, or equal to armor only 
- **Movement**
   - All characters start with 40' of combat movement and 120' of exploration movement. Any penalties to dex reduce movement, 5 feet per bonus point.

#### Armored Defense 

Armored defense represents your ability to avoid damage via reflexes, dodging, or just actual armor. It is equal to your dexterity defense and may be modified by light armor, shields, and helmets or replaced entirely by heavy armor (which can still be modified by shields and helmets).

**Optional rule: Role to defend.** Rather than the referee rolling to attack a character's armor defense, the character may roll 1d20 + their armor bonus (*armored defense - 10*) against the defense stat the attacker is using to attack with.

### Actions

- Attacks that are stealthy or subtle
- Stunts
   - Extinguishing fire
   - Removing acid
   - Doing a backflip
   - Trip
   - Disarm
   - Taking something out of deep inventory during combat

### Saves

- Escaping
- Dodging

## Intelligence

*Skill, education, common sense*

### Static

- **Maximum supply**, equal to intelligence defense 
- **Mana dice pool,** equal to intelligence bonus
- **Spell defense**, equal to intelligence defense 

### Actions

- Attacks using magic
- Attacks that are subtle
- Perception
- Deception
- Foraging for food or components
- Tinkering
- Lockpicking
- Picking pockets
- Forethought

## Willpower

*Charisma, luck, mental resilience*

### Static 

- **Magicked defense**, equal to willpower defense plus any wards
- **Maximum attuned magic items**, equal to willpower bonus (minimum 0)
- **Maximum retainers**, in hit dice, equal to willpower bonus (minimum 0)

#### Magicked Defense

Magicked defense represents your ability to resist spell damage and effects via sheer willpower, blessings, or luck. It is equal to your willpower defense and may be modified by wards.

**Optional rule: Roll to defend.** Rather than the referee rolling to attack a character's magicked defense, the character may roll 1d20 + their magicked bonus (*magicked defense - 10*) against the defense stat the attacker is using to cast with.

### Actions

- Influencing
- Intimidation
- Commanding retainers

### Saves

- Magic
- Morale


# Damage

When a character suffers damage, they may take grit or flesh damage. 

Grit represents to the character near misses, stunning blows, stamina depletion, superficial wounds and bruises, and so on. Once grit is depleted, the character will begin suffering damage to flesh. 

Flesh represents deep wounds, broken bones, internal and external bleeding, and so on. Once flesh is depleted, the character will fall into semi-consciousness. Any subsequent damage will kill the character. 

## Direct Damage

Some damage may bypass grit. Some damage may also outright kill a character. 

### NPC HP

Non-player characters do not distinguish between flesh and grit. Any direct damage instead inflicts triple the damage dice.

### Environmental

All of the following environmental damage (*in its non-magical form*) is considered **direct damage**, bypassing grit: 

- Non-magical fire, 1d6 direct damage
- On fire, 2d6 direct damage per round
- Lava, instant death
- Acid, 1d6 direct damage
- Drowning. Characters can hold their breath for 30 seconds (3 rounds of combat) per point of Strength bonus. After this point, they must make strength saving throws DC 15 every round or die. 
- Freezing water. Characters must make Strength saving throws DC 15 every minute or take 1 direct damage.
- Non-magical lightning, 3d6 direct damage
- Falling, 1d6 direct damage per 10 feet, to a maximum 10d6.
- Poison, direct damage (amount depends on the poison) 

### Ambush damage

If a character is ambushed, the damage is inflicted directly to the flesh points. The damage is the *normal weapon damage*. 

Characters when attacking in the same way *triple the damage dice* because NPCs do not have grit and flesh but one pool of hit protection.

## Death and Saving

Being reduced to 0 flesh points reduces your grit points to 0 (if not already reduced to 0) and requires stabilization within 1 minute or by the end of the combat, whichever is later, or the character dies.

If the character suffers damage while at 0 flesh, they die.

### Stabilization and Injury

An ally may try to stabilize the downed character by rolling an ability check, a spell, using herbs, or some other manner of healing. 

Once stabilized, the character rolls 1d20 on the permanent injury table: 

1. False hope: you're dead (1)
2. Lose a body part (2)
3. Feeble: lose 1d6 str (3-6)
4. Shaky: lose 1d6 dex (7-10)
5. Addled: lose 1d6 int (11-14)
6. Weak: lose 1d6 wil (15-18)
7. Disadvantage on all checks until rested (19)
8. Standing: Instantly heal to 1d8 grit (20)

Unless a 1 was rolled, the character heals to 1 flesh. 

#### Death 

When a character dies, write down their fate on the back of the character sheet. The character sheet may be ritualistically burned, buried, or sent off in a funeral boat later because the player should roll up another character (or ideally have another character waiting in the wings) to get back into the game.

#### Recovering from Injuries

The injuries feeble, shaky, addled, and weak may be removed after a number of weeks equal to the lowest result from rolling a number of d6 equal to character level. 

For example, a level 4 character rolls 4d6, resulting in a 3, 3, 5, and 6. The lowest number is 3, so the character's ability is restored after 3 weeks of rest. 

## Resting

A short rest takes 1 hour. 

A long rest takes 8 hours, 6 of which must be spent asleep. 

| Conditions                                 | Restored Grit | Restored Flesh |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------- | -------------- |
| Long rest in town or wilderness, with meal | 100%          | 1              |
| Wilderness, safe short rest                | L x d8 + str  | 0              |
| Short or long rest (with meal) in dungeon  | 1d8 + str     | 0              |

Long rests in a dungeon are inadvisable and are likely to fail. 

Resting must be safe and include food, drink, and (for long rests) sleep. Any interruption removes all benefits. The additional effects of ineffective resting follow: 

- **Hunger**. If characters do not eat in a day, they may not heal after their rests.
- **Sleep deprivation**. After a night of not sleeping, characters must roll at disadvantage until they rest. They do not heal from the rest. 
- **Thirst**. After one day of not drinking, characters must roll at disadvantage until they drink.  They do not heal from the rest. After three days, they must make strength saves every hour DC 15 or die. 

# Experience and Advancement

## Coins for XP

Recovered treasures can be spent for the coin value in experience. Only coins gained while adventuring or heist'd from someone count toward experience. Found coins or coins earned through honest work do not count. 

This money should not be spent on usable objects but on special interests: 

1. Carousing
2. Song, Fame, Statues, Paintings. Sponsoring bards and other artists to commemorate you.
3. Religion or Spirituality. Too much donated may cause the gods to pay too much attention to you and not always the god you're looking to appease.
4. Philanthropy
5. Events: races, gladiator shows, duels, masques, festivals, parades, triumphs, jousts, spectacles: you would be sponsoring these things
6. Land / Businesses
7. Training 
8. Hobbies: Animal husbandry, robotics, device creation, languages, brewing, hunting, art, spell research, item creation (smithing, for example).

**Optional rule: Special Interest Bonus and Deficit.** Characters can be rewarded / punished for spending their special interests in certain ways. At the beginning of the game, they can roll or choose their strong interest and weak interest, and apply a bonus and penalty to each, respectively.

For example:

- Strong: Philanthropy (120%)
- Weak: Land / Businesses (80%)

Each population has a limit as to how much can be spent there.

| Community  | Population | GP Limit (1d6 x #) |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Thorpe     | 20         | 10                 |
| Hamlet     | 200        | 50                 |
| Village    | 1,000      | 100                |
| Town       | 5,000      | 250                |
| City       | 25,000     | 1,000              |
| Metropolis | > 25,000   | 10,000                   |

The settlements only have so much stuff to give. Any more money spent in these settlements will cause economic ramifications that are better left not explored.

## Other XP Sources

Experience may also be rewarded for clever solutions and overcoming significant challenges. Winning over important allies or finding clues to a mystery could work.

Experience is not recommended as a reward for "good role-playing" since this may put some players at a disadvantage if they are not comfortable speaking in-character. 

## Advancement

Characters level up to 10. The following table describes the total XP needed at each level: 

| Level | XP Total |
| ----- | -------- |
| 1     | 0        |
| 2     | 1000     |
| 3     | 2000     |
| 4     | 4,000    |
| 5     | 8,000    |
| 6     | 16,000   |
| 7     | 32,000   |
| 8     | 64,000   |
| 9     | 120,000  |
| 10    | 240,000  |

1. Increase flesh score by 1.
2. Grit: Roll a number of d8s equal to your new level. If the value is higher than your maximum grit, this is your new grit. If it is lower or equal, increase grit by 1.
3. You receive 2 improvement points to spend. These improvement points can be used to either increase 1 ability by 2 points or 2 abilities by 1 point each. Improvements spent in this way increase both the bonus and defense of an ability. Abilities cannot be increased beyond +5.
   - **Optional rule**: You can spend up to 1 improvement point to instead take a knack. The other improvement point must be used to increase an ability by 1. 

### Knacks

In lieu of a single ability score improvement point, a character may take a knack. Knacks may be invented with collaboration of the referee. Keep in mind the power level of currently available knacks.

## Retirement

At any point, an adventurer is allowed to retire, but this is typically done at 10th level.

Have the character express a fear and a hope for the future. Roll 2d6: On 10+, their hope comes true; 7-9, their fate is mixed. On a 2-6, they should expect the worst.

Their fate should be written on the back of their character sheet. The referee cannot use this character as an NPC against the party and the character cannot return to be played.


# Items

## Reading an item line

Items are described with additional tags. 

*n*/*x*: This means there are n number of items out of a potential total x that can fit in a single inventory slot. For example, "torch 1/2" means there is one torch in this slot out of a potential 2 total. "arrows 20/20" means there are 20 arrows out of a potential total 20 in a single slot. 

*x*d*n*: This indicates the amount of dice to be rolled for an effect and which type. For example, "cudgel 1d4" is a cudgel that inflicts 1d4 damage. 

ad+*n*: This indicates a bonus to armored defense stat. 

ad=*n*: This indicates a replacement of the armored defense stat.

body, head, *n*h, feet: This indicates where an item is worn when equipped. *n*h indicates how many hands are in a character's hands. An item with 1h is carried in 1 hand, 2h in 2 hands.

md+*n*: This indicates a bonus to magicked defense stat.

*n* slots: This indicates that an object takes up multiple slots.

*reach, concealable, versatile, subtle, thrown*, etc: These are additional modifiers to weapons with special effects. 

*x*/*n*r: This indicates the range for an item in feet. The first number is the distance up to which an item can be thrown or fired, beyond which the item is thrown at disadvantage. The second number is as far as the item can be thrown or fired. Items with the thrown tag need this range number as well. 

at: This indicates that an item must be attuned to, which impacts the magical item limitation. All wards and magic items require attunement while items containing spells do not, unless otherwise specified.

## Inventory and Load

Inventory is a core feature of this game. Characters may carry up to their maximum load (equal to their strength defense).

Keeping track of it is important. Unless stated otherwise, every item takes up one slot. Smaller items can be grouped in bundles and treated as one slot. For example, "chalk, 20/20" means a bundle of 20 pieces of chalk taking up one slot. A slot can be assumed to weigh between 1 to 5 pounds or 1 to 2 kilos. It may also contain a magical item. 1-500 coins takes up one slot.

Unless they are magical, clothing, footwear, jewelry, backpacks, and sacks do not take up slots (though armor does).

### Quick Slots and Deep Slots

Getting an item out of your inventory during combat is considered a stunt with a DC equal to the slot number. On a success the stunt allows the stunt to be a free action. Otherwise it takes an action. 

Quick slots do not require a stunt to take out. Quick slots must contain items that are actively in your hands. 

### Encumbrance 

A character may choose to carry up to 5 items over their **maximum load** and be encumbered. An encumbered character takes a 5 foot movement penalty in combat and exploration for every slot over their limit and makes all rolls at disadvantage. 


## Supply

Supply is a nebulous item representing a quantity of consumable resources. It can be used to replace consumable resources and it is notated as "sup 5/5", taking up a single item slot. 1 supply can be purchased for 1 coin. 

You can only replace items you already have. It is not quantum gear.

You may only carry a number of supply equal to your intelligence defense. 

You may forage for supply once per day. 

## Food and Rations

Food is counted in rations. Rations acts as a unit, representing one full day's worth of meals. Rations should be counted as consumed during a long rest at the end of the day. 

Rations take up half a slot and are notated as "rations 2/2". Food should have this appended to the foodstuffs as a tag. For example, "shish kababs (rations 2/2)". 

## Currency

Coins are the currency. These can be named something else in the game: coppers, pence, pennies, rubles, dinari, yen, soles, crowns, groats, marks, ducats, etc.

1-500 coins take up one slot. 

### Costs

Note that unless stated otherwise, most common gear can be assumed to cost 1d10 coins (5).

## Armor

Armor augments armored defense. ad+n means that the armor augments the armored defense stat while ad=n means that the armored defense is set equal to that number without the dexterity bonus. 

Note that full plate and half plate assume that mail and gambesons may be part of the armored outfit. The armors denoted with *body* cannot be worn at the same time. This means that shields and helmets may augment ad=*n* suits of armor. A character wearing a shield, helmet, and full plate, for example, would have an armored defense of 18.

| armor                          | bonus | slots | placement   | cost  |
| ------------------------------ | ----- | ----- | ----------- | ----- |
| shield                         | +1    | 1     | 1h (1 hand) | 40    |
| helmet                         | +1    | 1     | head        | 40    |
| gambeson, padding, cloth armor | +1    | 1     | body        | 60    |
| brigandine, lamellar           | +2    | 2     | body        | 500   |
| mail                           | +3    | 3     | body        | 1,200 |
| half plate                     | =15   | 4     | body        | 4,000 |
| full plate                     | =16   | 5     | body        | 8,000      |

### Sundering Shields

When a character is hit and they carry a shield, they may choose to destroy the shield in order to avoid all damage.

- *Versatile:* This weapon is used with 2 hands.
- *2h:* Roll 2 weapon die and take the higher result.

   - The spear only has 10 foot reach when wielded with 2 hands even though it can also be wielded in 1 hand.

#### Sundering Melee Attacks

## Medicinals

Components can be foraged and combined into medicinals. Refer to **Foraging**.

Monster parts may also be used to craft items, in coordination with the referee and may require appropriate checks. Intelligence check against a DC equal to 10 + monster HD may be appropriate. 

### Crafting 

The following table has substances along with their application, effects, and recipes. Solvents can include oils, water, honey. Creating medicinals takes 10 minutes. All medicinals are 5 to a slot. For example, "Poultice 5/5". Medicinals are created one for one.

For creatures afflicted by diseases, combinations of medicinals below may be used to treat diseases, where sensible.

When choosing starting equipment, roll 1d10, or choose from medicinals 1-12 and receive 5/5 of the medicinal

## Magical Items

Magical items require attunement. Attuning requires 1 uninterrupted hour of contemplation with the object to be attuned. Attuned items must be in the attuned character's inventory in order to be used.

- **Weapons:** Weapons with magical properties. These always require attunement. Note that weapons of different materials (silver, gold, obsidian) are not magical unless specified to be magical. 
- **Focuses:** Wands, rods, staffs used to improve spell-casting. These always require attunement. You may only wield one of these at a time. 
- **Objects of Power:** Items with magical effects. These always require attunement. 
- **Wards:** Wards with protective magical abilities. These usually do not require attunement. 
- **Spells:** Artifacts, relics, spellbooks, and other objects that can be used to cast spells. Spells never require attunement.

### Attunement

Characters may carry any number of magical items but may only be attuned to a number of magical items equal to their willpower bonus. Attuning takes 1 hour and must be done during a period of rest. 

Magical items that have ongoing effects require attunement, while most spells (represented by items like spellbooks, tablets, idols, scrolls, runestones etc) do not. 

Wards also fall under this category and must be attuned to. Wards may be fetishes, bracelets, necklaces, rings, or other such items that provide a bonus to a character's magical defense stat. 

### Spells
Spells are cast from items, thereby removing the need for tracking separate spell slots. Spells take up item slots and must be used with two hands when cast. Spells do not typically require attunement.

### Wards
Wards augment magicked defense. Starting wards are very simple, likely made by the character, local religious figures, wise folks, or stumbled upon. 

Characters may not start with stronger wards than md+1.

- fetish md+1 at, 10 coins
- chain md+1 at, 20 coins
- charm md+1 at, 10 coins
- scapular md+1 at, 5 coins

Wards can be broken to nullify the effects of a spell on the wielder (and only the wielder). Other magical items do not have this ability, unless specified. For example, if a fireball is cast in an area and the target has a ward that they wish to break as a reaction to avoid all damage from the fireball, they may do so; however, anyone or anything else in that area of effect is still affected. Basically, this is not a free counterspell but a magical bubble. The ward cannot be repaired. 


# Hirelings

Player characters may hire any number of hirelings they can afford. 

All morale checks for hirelings use the employer's +wil bonus. 

**Settlement size modifiers** are used to determine the availability of a type of hireling. 

- Village: 1
- Town: 2
- City: 10
- Metropolis: 100

This value is re-rolled whenever a party returns to the settlement anew. This may result in more or fewer hirelings available. 

## Helpers

0HD. HP 1. MV 120 (40). 

**Role**: Hauling treasure and equipment, bearing torches. 

**Avoids**: Taking part in anything dangerous, like fighting monsters and detecting traps. 

**Breaking points:** Any sign of danger whatsoever. 

**Wages**: 10 coins / day

**Availability:** 1d10 x settlement size

## Experts

1HD. HP 2d4. INT 2. MV 120 (40).

**Role:** Provide services within their area of expertise. 

**Breaking points**: Danger beyond what was originally expected of them. Half HP. Half of allies out.

**Wages:** 20-100 coins / day

**Availability:** Varies on settlement size and rarity of expert. 

## Mercenaries

**Warrior.** 1HD. HP 2d4. AD 14 (helmet, shield, mail). MD 10. STR 2. MV 120 (40). Att 1 x 1d6 (short sword).

**Archer.** 1HD. HP 2d4. AD 13 (helmet, mail). MD 10. STR 2. MV 120 (40). Att 1 x 1d6 (bow).

**Role**: Protect employer from harm in the wilderness. 

**Breaking points:** Will not enter dungeons, expertise is limited to battlefield and one on one combat. Half HP. Half of allies out.

**Wages**: 20 coins / day

**Availability**: 1d8 x settlement size

## Retainers

**Sample stat line:** HD1. HP 3(6). AD 13 (shield, helmet). MD 10. STR 1 DEX 1, INT 1, WIL 0. MV 120 (40). Att 1 x 1d6 (short sword) or 1 x spell. Items: Firebolt (spellbook).

A retainer's stats should be rolled ahead of time just like level 1 player character and populate the world. 

**Avoids:** Retainers will only follow player characters of a higher level than they are. Therefore level 1 characters cannot hire retainers. 

You can command retainers of HD up to your wil bonus. For example, a character with +2 wil may have one 2HD retainer or 2 1HD retainers.

**Role:** Everything a player character does. 

**Wages:** Retainers earn a half share of experience and treasure and can gain levels over time.

**Breaking points:** Half HP. Half of allies out.

**Availability:** Retainers can be found in any settlement. 

### Retainer Maneuvers

Rather than take an action, a character may instead issue a command for their retainers to follow a specific order as a unit. Otherwise, retainers will fight to survive. 

To issue a command, a commander must make a +wil roll against a DC equal to the total HD of monsters in a combat (rounded up) or 10, whichever is higher.

On a failure the retainers will continue to fight to survive, but on a success, a character may order the retainers to perform specific coordinated tactics. This could include

- Charging
- Kiting
- Focus fire
- Cutting off escape
- Retreat
- Perform a stunt (like grabbing an item or passing characters items)
- Forming a shield wall


# Spell Casting

*Casting spells is dangerous.* 

Spells must be cast holding the spell item in two hands. When casting a spell, roll a number of **mana dice** up to your +int bonus plus 1 and, where applicable, a +int attack roll. 

## Spell Tags

- **Line of sight.** Unless otherwise specified by the spell, the spell requires line of sight on the target
- **D:** Duration. Spells with ongoing effects will be denoted as such. This is also where concentration will be denoted. 
- **R:** Range of spells, as a distance.
- **T:** The target(s) of the spell. 
- **\[dice\]** means the number of mana dice rolled. 
- **\[sum\]** means the sum of the mana dice rolled. 
- **Attack.** This refers to whether a spell requires a spell attack. This requires a d20+int attack against the target's magicked defense.
- **Save.** This refers to whether a spell requires a save from the target and specifies the ability. For +wil saves, the target uses their magicked defense bonus instead. The DC is always equal to the caster's intelligence defense. 
- **Concentration**. Some spells require concentration to maintain. If a spellcaster is attacked or performs an action other than maintaining concentration on the spell, the spell's effect ends. 

## Mana Dice

Mana dice are a pool of d6 equal to your 1+int bonus, minimum 0. Count the number of mana dice rolled and sum the total as well. Spells' features may depend on the number of dice rolled and the sum, or both, or neither. 

Mana dice are rolled in conjunction with spell attack dice, when applicable. Roll them all at once because even if the attack fails or only inflicts half damage or a weakened effect on the target, the results will still have a material impact. 

### Expending and Recovering Mana Dice

On a 1-3, the mana die returns to your pool. On a 4-6, the caster must have a long rest. The mana die returns at dawn. 

#### Wards as Mana Dice

Wards can also be used to contribute mana dice (1 for 1) and are destroyed on a roll of 4-6 and cannot be recovered. The ward is unaffected on a 1-3. When using a ward as a mana die, separate the roll by using a different color die or rolling it first or last, separately from the other dice. 

### Mishaps and Dooms

If the caster rolls **doubles** on their dice, a magical mishap occurs with the spell. 

If the caster rolls **triples** on their dice, they receive 1 doom. 

Mishaps may be avoided by destroying a **ward.** Dooms may be avoided by destroying **three wards**.

| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| 2   | Suffer 1d6 psychic damage                                                                                   |
| 3   | Random mutation for 1d6 rounds. Roll a +wil save against your own int defense or the mutation is permanent  |
| 4   | Blind, deafened, stunned, or in agony for 1d6 rounds                                                        |
| 5   | Ravenous hunger: Cannot cast spells or attack until you eat 1 ration. Does not count for your daily ration. |
| 6   | Spell targets you (if harmful) or enemy (if beneficial) or fizzles (if neutral)                             |

Count dooms as they accumulate.

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1st | Drop to 0 grit.                                                                             |
| 2nd | Lose the ability to cast spells for 3 days.                                                 | 
| 3rd | The spell escapes the artifact and you are trapped in the artifact now. You become a spell. |

### Coven Casting

With a magical ritual and symbols (like string tied around fingers, rings, tattoos, etc), characters may be bound together and **share** mana dice in a single pool. 

## Wild Magic

When casting magic, never be your main battery. Always use a buffer like a spellbook, artifact, focus, etc. 

But if you must: You may use mana dice as a way to tap into the wild magic of the world. Describe an effect and choose a target, and the referee should adjudicate the results, which will be hazardous and may not work as expected, and mishaps and dooms will still apply as well and may become even worse. 

## Spells 

Spells live inside artifacts, spellbooks, relics, tablets, and mundane items. Spells take up 1 inventory slot and usually do not require attunement.

# Dungeon Exploration

Exploring a dungeon is done in turns. Each turn represents 10 minutes of exploration. 

Sequence of play per turn: 

1. **Wandering monsters**, if present, move through the dungeon.
2. **Actions**: The party decides what action to take, like moving, searching, listening, entering a room. 
3. **Description**: The referee describes what happens. If monsters are encountered, refer to the combat section. 
4. **End of turn**: Referee updates time records, with special attention to light sources, spell durations, and the party's need to rest. 

## 1 Wandering Monsters

Roll 1d6 every 2 turns in a dungeon. On a 6, the wandering monster appears 2d6 x 10 feet moving toward the party. 

## 2 Actions

The party decides what action to take, like moving, searching, listening, entering a room. 

Characters may search for 
- room traps (within a 10 x 10 area)
- secret doors (within a 10 x 10 area)
- treasure traps (on a specific object or location)

**Darkvision is not perfect:** Monochrome outlines of moving shapes in darkness. Dim light is **moonlight** and even modern infantry doesn't conduct operations at night. Anything for which **fine eyesight** is required will be difficult even with darkvision.

There is a 1/6 chance of finding these things. The roll is made in secret by the referee. 

There is a 2 in 6 chance that a trap is triggered when a character makes an action that could trigger the trap. 

Characters move at a rate of 3 times their base speed. So a character that moves 40 feet in a combat turn moves 120 feet in a dungeon turn, which represents slow careful movement.

Movement through already explored areas may be allowed at a faster rate. 

## 3 Description

Referee describes what happens. 

## 4 End of Turn

- **Time-keeping device:** Measure the amount of time they are in the dungeon. Use 1d6 where every activity is 10 minutes and every die is one hour. From 6 to 1, their **torches burns out**. Other taxing conditions can take effect (cold, heat, magical effects, etc)
- After 1 hour (6 dungeon turns), the characters **must rest for 1 turn** or will suffer disadvantage on attack rolls. 

Resting for 1 hour in the dungeon heals 1d8 + str bonus. Resting for 8 hours is not possible in a dungeon.

## Rolling to Return

Sometimes there is insufficient time to escape a dungeon to a safe location during a session. When it is necessary that a party be back in civilization or back at a camp, as may be during a Western Marches campaign, the characters may roll to return to a safe camp. 

The referee determines whether this is a dangerous or arduous journey.

DC = 10 + hour of travel, maximum of DC 20

On a success, the characters return to camp. 

On a failure, the characters pay a cost: 

- Dangerous: 1d6 damage is inflicted for every 1 under the DC
- Arduous: lose 1 load of equipment per 1 under the DC

If a character is reduced to 0 flesh, they die or are left unconscious, suffering all of the effects of being reduced to 0. The referee picks what load is dropped, starting with less valuable and less secure items, and working up to weapons and armor. 

# Wilderness Exploration

## Watches

Days are split up into 6 watches (about 3 in the day and 3 in the night), each 4 hours long. 

A navigator should be declared. 

## Traveling

Characters move 6 miles per watch (4 hours).

Movement is halved through difficult terrain, in darkness, and in bad weather. Movement is doubled when riding a mount or going solely by road. 

### Forced March

Traveling longer than 3 watches (12 hours) requires a +str save of DC 15 per additional watch or suffer 1 point of direct damage (to flesh). 

### Navigation

Navigator determines direction and navigates. The referee rolls that character's +int as necessary (determined by table below). If the characters have an accurate map, this is also not necessary:

| Navigation                                                     | DC       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Road, open sea with land in sight                              | No check |
| Grassland, coast, plains, farmland                             | 5        |
| Arctic, desert, hills, open sea with clear skies               | 10       |
| Forest, jungle, swamp, mountains, open sea with overcast skies | 15       |
| Any region with white-out precipitation                        | +3       |
:Navigation

#### Failed Navigation

On a failed navigation check, the referee should roll 1d10 in secret. 

| d10  | Direction               |
| ---- | ----------------------- |
| 1-4  | veered into left hex    |
| 5-6  | arrived in intended hex |
| 7-10 | veered into right hex   |
:Failed Navigation (Lost)

## Activities

Characters can spend a full watch in a 30 square mile area (6 mile hex) in order to forage or explore. 

### Exploring 

Players spending time exploring find points of interest that wouldn't be identified while traveling right through a hex. 

### Foraging  

Characters may forage and hunt for food. This requires a +int check depending on the environment. Such a check may also be impossible in certain environments. 

| Foraging                                    | DC  |
| ------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Abundant food and water sources             | 10  |
| Limited food and water sources              | 15  |
| Very little, if any, water and food sources | 20  |
:Foraging

A successful roll yields 1d6 worth of food. Food is maximum 2 per slot.

#### Foraging for Components

Rather than hunting for food, characters may search for components for medicinals. Search as above, but on a success, roll 1d12 per +int bonus. Roll 1d4 for each, receiving that amount. 

All components are a maximum of 5 per slot.

### Camping 

Camping may require an alert member keeping watch. A safe short rest restores L x d8 + str bonus in grit while a long rest in the wilderness with a meal restores 100% grit and 1 flesh. 

# Combat 

## Initiative 
The characters roll 1d6. On a 4 and above, the player characters go first; on a 3 and below, the enemy goes first. Creatures on each side go at the same time, deciding and declaring their actions together. Initiative is re-rolled every round. 

**Optional rule: Dex check against enemy dex score.** Alternatively each character must roll +dex against the dexterity defense of the enemy with the highest dexterity defense. Every character who rolls at or above that number goes ahead of the enemies, while every character who rolls under that number goes after the enemies. Initiative is not re-rolled. 

## Turns 

Turns consist of movements and actions and free actions. Reactions may also occur during the opposing turn when relevant. Movement away from an enemy does not provoke attacks of opportunity unless the enemy has a skill that says it does. 

Movement is 40 feet, typically. A single action may be performed which could be

- a melee or ranged attack
- reloading a crossbow 
- casting a spell (Refer to **Magic**)
- doing a stunt
- taking something out of your inventory
   - roll +dex versus the DC equal to the item's position in your inventory. On a success, you do the action for free and can take another action. On a failure, you retrieve the item anyway. 
- moving again
- intimidate (when the opposing side has half or fewer enemies left)
- give an order to retainers

Or anything else the referee may deem acceptable. 

### Attacking

Melee attacks may be made within 5-10 feet. Ranged attacks cannot be made within melee range. Make a melee or ranged attack by rolling 1d20 and adding the relevant bonus (usually str, but sometimes int or dex). If this value is equal to or over the enemy's armored defense score, the attack hits. The attacker then rolls the weapon's damage die. 

#### Sundering Attack 

Before rolling damage for a melee attack, a character may choose to destroy their weapon in order to inflict double the dice in damage. 

#### Improvised Damage

Unarmed strikes inflict damage equal to the strength bonus (minimum 0).

Physical damage from small things can be measured in d4 (caltrops, spikes, ball bearings--trip damage)

Physical damage from big things can be measured in d6 (carts, bookshelves, folding chairs)

Elemental damage can be measured in d6 (acid, fire, frost)

**Optional rule: Roll to defend.** If it is preferred to have all of the rolls player-facing, then when an enemy creature makes a melee or ranged attack, roll 1d20 + armored defense bonus against the defense of the ability the enemy is using. If they succeed, the attack misses. If they fail, the attack hits. 

### Morale checks

A player may request a morale check after certain breaking points: 

- A leader is killed 
- Half of their allies are killed 
- Half of their HP is reduced (if alone)
- Ambushed
- Attacked by something they fear

The requesting character must make a +wil check against the enemy leader's (or strongest remaining enemy's) willpower defense. On a success, the enemies surrender or rout; on a failure, the characters must wait for another breaking point to try again. 

### Retreating

A side may retreat on their turn. Choosing to retreat forces a check against the opponent's relevant defense, depending on the nature of the retreat. 

Concentration is broken and no other actions may be taken if a side chooses to retreat. On a successful retreat check, the character manages to escape. On a failed retreat check, they stop moving, unable to escape. Retreated characters move twice their speed in their chosen direction, as long as it is not through an enemy space. 

Any retainers or allies must make a wil save (morale) at disadvantage versus the strongest enemy's wil defense. On a failure, they rout and try to flee, often dying in the panic. 

#### Chase

1. Before anything else, a **pursued** may drop an item. If it is something a **pursuer** desires, roll willpower (morale) to see if the pursuer stops pursuit to take the item.
2. To flee or pursue, the party member with the lowest Dexterity in the party does an **opposed Dexterity save** against the enemy's Dexterity.
3. Find the difference between the rolled result and the Dexterity score. The player party gains that many "**steps**" if they succeed. The enemy gains that many "**steps**" if they succeed.
4. **A.** If the pursued are 5 steps ahead, they've lost the pursuers. If the player party has  
    successfully fled, check the enemy's morale to determine whether they search for the player party.  **B.** If the pursuers catch up to the pursued, the chase is over and the pursuers automatically win initiative.

Pursuit requires line of sight from the monster. If the characters are able to duck around a corner, the monster may avoid this combat. 

## Critical Hits

On a natural 20, an attack inflicts twice the dice in damage. On a natural 1, the attack may provide an opening to the opposing side, granting an advantageous position to the opposing side, unless it is mitigated by something else. 

## Advantage

Creatures gain advantage from advantageous situations, such as ambushes. 

When a creature has advantage, they may choose to perform a stunt and an attack at the same time. 

## Disadvantage 

Creatures suffer disadvantage from disadvantageous situations, such as being caught unawares or aiming at a creature that is behind partial cover. 

## Conditions

- Exhausted: Disadvantage on all rolls.
- Paralyzed
- Grappled: Speed is 0, disadvantage on all rolls except to break the grapple.
- Charmed: Acting friendly towards 
- Blind
- Deafened
- Stunned

# Downtime

## Lifestyle

There are there levels of upkeep. These numbers should be used during downtime: 
1. Meager: 1 coin / day; 7 coins / week; 30 coins / month
2. Comfortable: L coins / day; L x 7 coins / week; L x 30 coins / month
3. Luxurious: L x 5 coins / day; L x 35 coins / week; L x 150 coins / month

## Magical Research

Inventing spells is dangerous. When working to invent a spell, spend 1,000 coins in research activities and resources, spend a week in time, acquire an object to house the spell, and roll +int against a DC 20. On a success, you create the spell with the referee and must cast it once using all of your mana dice. On a fail, roll all of your mana dice and make a +mdef save against your int defense. On a success, any dooms and mishaps are negated. On a failure, they are not. 

## Mastercrafting 

You spend time with a master crafter to improve your weapons. Applying additional effects to weapons (such as silvering or gilding or reinforcing) costs coin to be adjudicated by the referee. 

## Brewing and Crafting

Inventing potions is dangerous. When working to invent a potion, spend 1,000 coins in research activities and resources, spend a week in time, and roll +int against a DC 20. On a success, you gain potions 5/5. On a failure, your brewing goes wrong and you suffer a mishap, adjudicated by the referee. 


# Names Tables

For the default setting of Isurholm, you can choose from the below names.

Roll 1d4 to determine ethnic background. 
1. **Isuri:** Inhabitants of Isurholm, descended from humans who invaded from across the sea after the Werriadi civilization collapsed centuries before. The Otani call them Galoli, meaning foreigner.
2. **Otani:** Original inhabitants of Isurholm, which they call Otyde. Called Strangers by the Isuri. They claim descent from the Disirlings.
3. **Aegerlings:** Exonym for the invaders from across the sea. Also called Outlanders. Originally from Attaland, and they call themselves Attalanders. 
4. **Piastri**: Visitors from across the sea, claiming descent from the Disirlings.

You may also come up with your own name.
