# Hirelings
Player characters may hire any number of hirelings they can afford. Not to be confused with [[Retainers]].

All morale checks for hirelings use the employer's +wil bonus. 

**Settlement size modifiers** are used to determine the availability of a type of hireling. 

- Village: 1
- Town: 2
- City: 10
- Metropolis: 100

This value is re-rolled whenever a party returns to the settlement anew. This may result in more or fewer hirelings available.
