# Initiative

As I've said many times, rolling for initiative sucks. Here are optional rules for determining initiative and surprise. All of these are side-based initiative contests, meaning each side goes at the same time. There are rules for combat in other games where certain types of actions go before or after others. You will not find those in this rule set.

## Simple Side-Based Initiative

Both sides roll 1d6. On a 1 or 2, that side is **surprised** and the other side may have a free round before initiative begins. If both sides roll 1 or 2, neither is surprised. 

After surprise is determined and, if applicable, the surprise round ends, the characters roll 1d6. On a 4 and above, the player characters go first; on a 3 and below, the enemy goes first. Creatures on each side go at the same time, deciding and declaring their actions together. 

Initiative is re-rolled every round. 

## Contested Dexterity Checks

Each character must roll +dex against the dexterity defense of the enemy with the highest dexterity defense. Every character who rolls at or above that number is part of the group that goes ahead of the enemies, while every character who rolls under that number is part of the group that goes after the enemies. Initiative is not re-rolled. Order is determined per group, not by the recorded numbers of each character. 

For example, Wirebower rolls a 21 and Sigra rolls a 16, beating the enemy bear's dexterity defense score of 13, while Boxolumpf rolls a 9 and Masros rolls a 7. Wirebower and Sigra act first, then the bear, then Boxolumpf and Masros.

Surprise is established contextually.

## Leader Initiative and Surprise

Both sides' leaders roll initiative, higher +dex winning ties. If one side beats the other by 10, the winning side gets a surprise round. Initiative is re-rolled every round (without the surprise effect possible).
