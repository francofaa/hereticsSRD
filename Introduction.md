# Introduction

## Premise 

The characters are in a low magic world, secret followers of a heretical religion, seekers of forbidden and lost magical artifacts containing living spells. The world is strange and weird, mysterious and beautiful. 



## Principles for Players

- **Danger is real.** Make a few characters to start with. Choosing combat is always the most dangerous option, but that also means,
- **Your choices matter.** A bad decision may mean death for your character or some other fate worse than death, but that also means that every choice you make is significant and meaningful.
- **Quick character creation.** Characters can be randomly generated in a few minutes, with abilities, equipment, hit protection, names, and even personality traits. 
- **The party, not the characters.** The story of the party can be told over the course of adventures. Some characters will enter and depart, but the party continues.
- **Story, not backstory.** It is not recommended to come in with a big rich backstory because of how dangerous and deadly the game can be. The game should be about the story you are telling together, not the novel you brought in (or the novel you are writing). Even if your character dies, any backstory can be revealed through the diary they kept with them, small personal effects, or stories your character's sibling tells when they inevitably join the party. A fallen companion can still have a ripple effect on the party as it goes on. As a wise friend once said, "My characters don't have backstories, only forward stories."
- **Down to clown, adventure-wise.** Exploration and adventure is a big part of the game. Make sure you make a character who *wants* to be out here, delving into dungeons, uncovering ancient secrets. If the character no longer wants to do that, there is a retirement mechanic.
- **Hit protection is not health.** Your hit protection is your stamina, more or less. You can't swim across a pool of lava and quaff a health potion and be good. Also, there are no health potions. Let's just get that out of the way.
- **Healing is slow.** Healing only occurs when you have the time and resources to do so. 
- **Player ingenuity over character abilities.** As in real life, the only way to guarantee victory is with ingenuity, cunning, cleverness, planning, and overwhelming force. Luck is fickle and your modifiers aren't that good.
- **Magic is dangerous.** Mishaps will happen and dooms may occur. Spells are alive and live inside of objects. You can cast magic without artifacts and invent spells or magical effects on the fly but it's dangerous to be your own battery.
- **Level-less spells.** Spells are just spells and their power increases depending on how much power you imbue into it using mana dice.
- **No dump stats, no god stats.** There are only four ability scores (strength, dexterity, intelligence, and willpower) and they are set up in pairs (physical vs mental and offensive vs defensive). A spell-caster with high strength can carry more spell books, and a melee fighter with high willpower can command more retainers.
- **But no classes, just inventory.** No classes means everyone can cast spells, swing swords, charm merchants, and walk across a tightrope. Knacks help characters specialize but ultimately, what you have is what you can do. And inventory management is important but it is simplified with a slot mechanic. 
- **Your character is not the sheet.** If your ability score is low, it doesn't mean you have to roleplay it that way. It just means you have to prepare more to accommodate for the potential of failure. Avoid ever having to roll.
- **Travel and resources.** Journeying through the wilderness to get to the dungeon can be dangerous, and keeping fed will keep you alive and able to rest. 
- **Rounds, Turns, Watches, Cycles.** Combat split into rounds with side-based initiative; dungeon exploration split into turns of 10 minutes to find traps, strategize, loot, investigate, and sneak; journeys split into 6 watches of 4 hours each for traveling, climbing, resting, foraging, and hunting; downtime split into cycles of weeks or months for resting, faction play, crafting, shopping, researching, and brewing. 

## Principles for Referees 
- **Simple monsters.** Monster stat blocks are stat lines. Their difficulty level is indicated by their hit dice (HD).
- **Failure.** Failure does not necessarily mean the character fails what they set out to do and should really never mean nothing happens. Because "nothing happens" is never the worst thing that could happen.
- **Play to find out what happens.** Let the players direct what they want to do. Be surprised and be their fan. Abide by the dice and roll out in the open, unless it would impact verisimilitude. 
- **Play the world as real.** The world goes on without you. NPCs want things. Your characters want things. And remember that money and power are means to an end, not the end itself. What is that end?
- **The monsters know what they're doing.** The creatures in this world have their own wants and may not always stand and fight to the death. They may be reasoned with, and they may try to conspire against (or with) the characters. 
- **Rulings over rules.** If at any time a rule is unclear or doesn't make sense or there is an argument over it, make a decision and move the game along, and put a pin in the rule and email me about it please. It's important to move the game along.
- **Players, not characters.** Along with the above rule, also make sure that when a player character dies, that player has another character that can jump in quickly, even if it seems unlikely. Who cares. We all want to play and it sucks to sit on the sidelines for any amount of time. Whether it makes sense ("I was exploring this dungeon too!" "I've been looking everywhere for you!" "I was just a torch bearer but that PC's death made me gain a PC level and now I'm also here. Can I have their stuff?") or not ("I'm Hank's son, Hank 2, but just call me Hank"), just keep it moving. 
- **Fudge is for eating.** Don't fudge rolls: You are the world, and the world sometimes deals a bad hand. Roll openly to preserve this until you get the hang of it.
