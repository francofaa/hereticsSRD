# Introduction

## Premise 

The heretics are in a low magic world, secret followers of a mysterious [Source](Source), an entity that grants them power. They are seekers of forbidden and lost magical artifacts containing living spells. Make the world weird and beautiful. The Source communicates in strange patterns: fire, winds, the flight paths of birds. 

The players may treat their Source like an aloof warlock patron that checks in every now and then and doesn't ask for much, or like an overly involved otherworldly entity on their shoulder, asking when they're gonna find that goat for the sacrifice, it's been weeks. 

## General Principles 

- **The referee is the world, not the adversary.** The referee must portray the rules, situations, narrative, and NPCs clearly, neutrally, and without subterfuge.
- **No classes, just inventory.** No classes means everyone can cast spells, swing swords, charm merchants, and walk across a tightrope. Ultimately, what you have is what you can do. Inventory management is important but it is simplified with a slot system.
- **Advancement through customization.** Boons help characters specialize via their shared power, the Source. 
- **Death is on a ticking clock.** Heretics witness omens of their death and are left with lingering injuries after hitting zero hit protection. The omens accumulate and every time they fall could be their last.
- **The party, not the characters.** The players should work together toward shared goals and character goals. The story of the party can be told over the course of adventures. Some heretics will enter and depart, but the party and their mysterious font of power continue. 
- **Consequences are real and knowable.** Players must understand the reasons behind the choices they make. The referee must make the obvious consequences and risks of failure and success plainly understood in the fiction. There is more tension there than just surprising them with a sudden defeat. The referee must make the unknowns clear as well.


## Principles for Players

- **Danger is real.** Make a few characters to start with. Choosing combat is always the most dangerous option, but that also means,
- **Your choices matter.** A bad decision may mean death for your character or some other fate worse than death, but that also means that every choice you make is significant and meaningful.
- **Quick character creation.** Heretics can be randomly generated in a few minutes, with abilities, equipment, hit protection, names, and even personality traits. 
- **Story, not backstory.** As a wise friend once said, "My characters don't have backstories, only forward stories." The game should be about the story you are telling together, not the novel you brought in (or the novel you are writing). But even if your heretic dies, they are not insignificant. A fallen companion can still have a ripple effect on the party as it goes on: Diaries, small personal effects, stories the fallen heretic's sibling tells when they inevitably join the party. 
- **Down to clown, adventure-wise.** Exploration and adventure is a big part of the game. Make a heretic who *wants* to be out here, exploring and uncovering ancient secrets. If the character no longer wants to do that, there is a retirement mechanic.
- **Hit protection is not health.** Your hit protection is your stamina, more or less. You can't swim across a pool of lava and quaff a health potion and be good. Also, there are no health potions. Let's just get that out of the way.
- **Healing is slow.** Healing only occurs when you have the time and resources to do so. 
- **No dump stats, no god stats.** There are only four ability scores (strength, dexterity, willpower, and intelligence) and they are set up in pairs (physical vs mental and graceful vs forceful). A spell-caster with high strength can carry more spell books, and a melee fighter with high willpower can command more retainers.
- **Player ingenuity over character abilities.** As in real life, the only way to guarantee victory is with ingenuity, cunning, cleverness, planning, and overwhelming force. Luck is fickle and your modifiers aren't that good.
- **Your character is not the sheet.** If your ability score is low, it doesn't mean you have to roleplay it that way. It just means you have to prepare more to accommodate for the potential of failure. Avoid ever having to roll.
- **Fighting is dangerous.** Use caution. Make plans. Fighting isn't necessarily a fail state, but it introduces significantly more variables. 
- **Magic is dangerous.** Mishaps will happen and dooms may occur. Spells are alive. You can cast magic without artifacts and invent spells or magical effects on the fly but it's dangerous to be your own battery.
- **Level-less spells.** Spells are just spells and their power increases depending on how much power you imbue into it using magic dice.
- **Teamwork.** Communicate with your fellow heretics. Seek consensus rather than charging ahead. Goals and limits should be communicated and respected.
- **Travel and resources.** Journeying through the wilderness to get to the dungeon can be dangerous, and keeping fed will keep you alive and able to rest. 
- **Play the world as real.** The world goes on without you. NPCs want things. Your characters want things. And remember that money and power are means to an end, not the end itself. What is that end?
- **No winners, no losers.** There is no single solution to situations in the world. 

## Principles for Referees 

- **Be open and keep the conversation going.** Provide details as they explore. Be clear and direct. You are not the antagonist. You are the referee, guiding them through the world. Answer questions consistently and honestly. 
- **Don't hide anything behind a roll.** Players should not need to roll to see if they notice something. Let them ask questions to get to the answers. 
- **Roll only when the outcome is uncertain.** If something is impossible, don't allow the player to roll. If there's no chance something will fail, just let them do it.
- **Provide the players with opportunities.** If the players express wants and needs within the fiction, give them opportunities to play those out. 
- **Failure.** Failure does not necessarily mean the character fails what they set out to do and should really never mean nothing happens. Because "nothing happens" is never the worst thing that could happen.
- **Play to find out what happens.** Let the players direct what they want to do. Be surprised and be their fan. Abide by the dice and roll out in the open, unless it would impact verisimilitude. 
- **The NPCs know what they're doing.** The creatures in this world have their own wants and may not always stand and fight to the death. They may be reasoned with, and they may try to conspire against (or with) the characters. They also have memory. The heretics will make enemies as well as friends.
- **Situations, not plots.** Plots are for novels. Use settings, random tables, and generative procedures to create situations. The story will emerge from interacting with the world.
- **Offer choices.** When a situation is vague or the players' plans are unclear, present the choices in a binary ("Do you want to kidnap the archbishop or turn on the vampire duke?") to force outcomes. Keep the conversation flowing. 
- **Rulings over rules.** If at any time a rule is unclear or doesn't make sense or there is an argument over it, make a decision and move the game along, and put a pin in the rule and email me about it please.
- **Players over characters.** Make sure that when a player character finally dies, that player has another character that can jump in quickly, even if it seems unlikely. Who cares. We all want to play and it sucks to sit on the sidelines for any amount of time. Whether it makes sense ("I was exploring this dungeon too!" "I've been looking everywhere for you!" "I was just a torch bearer but that PC's death made me gain a PC level and now I'm also here. Can I have their stuff?") or not ("I'm Hank's son, Hank 2, but just call me Hank"), just keep it moving. 
- **Fudge is for eating.** Don't fudge rolls: You are the world, and the world sometimes deals a bad hand. Roll openly to preserve this until you get the hang of it.
- **Telegraph danger.** Make traps and monsters obvious and scary. The tension should come from the players interacting with the world and coming up with their own solution. There's no tension in "rocks fall, everyone dies."

## Safety Tools

The themes, premise, and mechanics of Heretics can be dark, but the game you play doesn't have to be. By their nature, content warnings can be scary just being mentioned. The items that this warning includes are not viscerally described but are worth keeping in mind when presenting a session of Heretics to your players. 

Here follow some specific warnings:

- Death and [horrible injury](Damage#omens) are expected, but can be described to the table's comfort.
- There is one [Boon](Boons) that references self-harm, which can be removed or modified.
- There are [Aspects](Source#aspects) of the [Source](Source) that reference body horror, which can also be removed.
- The premise is that of a [deity-like entity](Source) and its followers, which can trigger religious trauma, but I recommend treating the Source as an aloof warlock patron out of the box.

The European medieval historical eras that fantasy role-playing games pretend that they're replicating may have been horrible, but that doesn't mean your table wants to act them out. Make sure to 

- have a conversation where everyone can communicate their lines (hard no's) and veils (fade to black, do not describe in detail)
- consider introducing X, N, and O cards to interrupt play for potentially triggering situations
- allow for mental breaks every hour
- debrief on the game if there was any triggering content or conflict that needs to be resolved
