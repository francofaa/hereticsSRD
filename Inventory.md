# Inventory

Inventory is a core feature of this game. Characters may carry up to their maximum load (equal to their strength defense). Keeping track of it is important. Unless stated otherwise, every item takes up one slot. 

A slot can be assumed to weigh between 1 to 5 pounds or 1 to 2 kilos. It may also contain a [magical item](magicalitems) or a [spell](d100spells).

1-500 coins takes up one slot. Smaller items can be grouped in bundles and treated as one slot. For example, "chalk, 20/20" means a bundle of 20 pieces of chalk taking up one slot. 

## Reading an item line
Items are described with additional tags. 

*n*/*x*: This means there are n number of items out of a potential total x that can fit in a single inventory slot. For example, "torch 1/3" means there is one torch in this slot out of a potential 3 total. 

*x*d*n*: This indicates the amount of dice to be rolled for an effect and which type. For example, "cudgel 1d4" is a cudgel that inflicts 1d4 damage. 

ad+*n*: This indicates a bonus to armored defense stat. 

ad=*n*: This indicates a replacement of the armored defense stat.

body, head, *n*h, feet: This indicates where an item is worn when equipped. *n*h indicates how many hands are in a character's hands. An item with 1h is carried in 1 hand, 2h in 2 hands.

md+*n*: This indicates a bonus to warded defense stat.

*n* slots: This indicates that an object takes up multiple slots.

*reach, concealable, versatile, subtle, thrown*, etc: These are additional modifiers to weapons with special effects. 

*x*/*n*r: This indicates the range for an item in feet. The first number is the distance up to which an item can be thrown or fired, beyond which the item is thrown at disadvantage. The second number is as far as the item can be thrown or fired. Items with the thrown tag need this range number as well. 


## Quick Slots and Deep Slots
Getting an item out of your inventory during [combat rounds](combatround) is considered a stunt (dexterity check) with a DC equal to the slot number. On a success the stunt allows the stunt to be a free action. Otherwise it takes an action. 

Quick slots do not require a stunt to take out. Quick slots must contain items that are actively in your hands. 

## Encumbrance

A character may choose to carry up to 5 items over their **maximum load** and be encumbered. An encumbered character takes a 5 foot movement penalty in combat and exploration for every slot over their limit and makes all rolls at disadvantage. 

## Food and Rations
Food is counted in rations. Rations act as a unit, representing one full day's worth of meals. Rations should be counted as consumed during a long rest at the end of the day. 

Rations take up half a slot and are notated as "rations 5/5". Food should have this appended to the foodstuffs as a tag. For example, "shish kababs (rations 5/5)". Rations 5/5 represent 5 days' worth of food. Rations 1/5 represents 1 days' worth of food.

## Currency
Coins are the currency. These can be named something else in the game: coppers, pence, pennies, rubles, dinari, yen, soles, crowns, groats, marks, ducats, etc.

1-500 coins take up one slot. 

### Costs
Note that unless stated otherwise, most common gear can be assumed to cost 1d10 coins (5).

## Ammo

Ammo is quantum, meaning that it can be used for any ammunition based weapon. For example, if a character has a sling and a bow, they may use the ammo as either a stone or an arrow.

A character may carry ammunition up to their dexterity defense stat. Ammo does not take up inventory slots and is tracked separately. 

Ammo can be replaced one for one by **supply**.

Ammo may be harvested from enemies or foraged and made during a [wilderness watch](wildernesswatch). One piece of ammo can be purchased for 1 coin.

## Supply

Supply is a nebulous item representing a quantity of consumable resources. It can only be used to replace consumable resources *that you already have*. For example, if you have torches 2/3 and sup 1/5, you can use that 1 supply to fill up your torches once more. 

It  cannot stand in for things you do not already have. If you have no torches, you may not replenish torches by adding 1 supply. 

You may carry a number of supply equal to your intelligence defense. Supply does not take up inventory slots and is tracked separately. 

You may forage for supply during a [wilderness watch](wildernesswatch). One supply can be purchased for 1 coin. 


## Sundries

Unless they are magical, worn things like clothing, footwear, jewelry, and backpacks do not take up slots (though armor does) and may be added to sundries in the character's inventory. This may also include small things that could conceivably fit in someone's pockets and that would not take up an entire inventory slot. Confer with the referee for what can be considered a sundry. 


## Gear Packs

In lieu of a specific item, a character may carry a gear pack. Potential packs include:

- burglary
- climbing
- disguise
- scribing
- alchemist
- brewer
- miner

Most professions can have an associated gear pack. Gear packs take up 5 slots. When a character wants to use an item from the pack, they declare what the item is and therefore has always been. The item replaces one of the gear pack slots. 

A gear pack slot can also replace a bundle of items. 

For example, a smithing pack slot can be replaced by nails (20/20). Or a character wants to have a crowbar. They replace their one burglary gear pack slot with one crowbar.

One slot of a gear pack always costs 10 coins (the maximum price for a common item).
