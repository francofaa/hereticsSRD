# Items

## Reading an item line
Items are described with additional tags. 

*n*/*x*: This means there are n number of items out of a potential total x that can fit in a single inventory slot. For example, "torch 1/2" means there is one torch in this slot out of a potential 2 total. "arrows 20/20" means there are 20 arrows out of a potential total 20 in a single slot. 

*x*d*n*: This indicates the amount of dice to be rolled for an effect and which type. For example, "cudgel 1d4" is a cudgel that inflicts 1d4 damage. 

ad+*n*: This indicates a bonus to armored defense stat. 

ad=*n*: This indicates a replacement of the armored defense stat.

body, head, *n*h, feet: This indicates where an item is worn when equipped. *n*h indicates how many hands are in a character's hands. An item with 1h is carried in 1 hand, 2h in 2 hands.

md+*n*: This indicates a bonus to warded defense stat.

*n* slots: This indicates that an object takes up multiple slots.

*reach, concealable, versatile, subtle, thrown*, etc: These are additional modifiers to weapons with special effects. 

*x*/*n*r: This indicates the range for an item in feet. The first number is the distance up to which an item can be thrown or fired, beyond which the item is thrown at disadvantage. The second number is as far as the item can be thrown or fired. Items with the thrown tag need this range number as well. 

at: This indicates that an item must be attuned to, which impacts the magical item limitation. All wards and magic items require attunement while items containing spells do not, unless otherwise specified.

## Inventory and Load
Inventory is a core feature of this game. Characters may carry up to their maximum load (equal to their strength defense). Keeping track of it is important. Unless stated otherwise, every item takes up one slot. 

A slot can be assumed to weigh between 1 to 5 pounds or 1 to 2 kilos. It may also contain a [magical item](magicalitems) or a [spell](d100spells).

1-500 coins takes up one slot. Smaller items can be grouped in bundles and treated as one slot. For example, "chalk, 20/20" means a bundle of 20 pieces of chalk taking up one slot. 

> Refer to [Supply](Supply) for rules on the nebulous concept of supply which can be used to replace consumable resources such as chalk 20/20 or torch 2/2 one for one.

Unless they are magical, worn things like clothing, footwear, jewelry, and backpacks do not take up slots (though armor does).

### Quick Slots and Deep Slots
Getting an item out of your inventory during [combat rounds](combatrounds) is considered a stunt (dexterity check) with a DC equal to the slot number. On a success the stunt allows the stunt to be a free action. Otherwise it takes an action. 

Quick slots do not require a stunt to take out. Quick slots must contain items that are actively in your hands. 

### Encumbrance 
A character may choose to carry up to 5 items over their **maximum load** and be encumbered. An encumbered character takes a 5 foot movement penalty in combat and exploration for every slot over their limit and makes all rolls at disadvantage. 

## Food and Rations
Food is counted in rations. Rations act as a unit, representing one full day's worth of meals. Rations should be counted as consumed during a long rest at the end of the day. 

Rations take up half a slot and are notated as "rations 2/2". Food should have this appended to the foodstuffs as a tag. For example, "shish kababs (rations 2/2)". Rations 2/2 represent 2 days' worth of food. Rations 1/2 represents 1 days' worth of food.

## Currency
Coins are the currency. These can be named something else in the game: coppers, pence, pennies, rubles, dinari, yen, soles, crowns, groats, marks, ducats, etc.

1-500 coins take up one slot. 

### Costs
Note that unless stated otherwise, most common gear can be assumed to cost 1d10 coins (5).
