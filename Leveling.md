# Leveling
Characters may level up to 10. The following table describes the total XP needed at each level: 

| Level | XP Total |
| ----- | -------- |
| 1     | 0        |
| 2     | 1000     |
| 3     | 2000     |
| 4     | 4,000    |
| 5     | 8,000    |
| 6     | 16,000   |
| 7     | 32,000   |
| 8     | 64,000   |
| 9     | 120,000  |
| 10    | 240,000  |

1. Increase flesh score by 1.
2. Grit: Roll a number of d8s equal to your new level. If the value is higher than your maximum grit, this is your new grit. If it is lower or equal, increase grit by 1.
3. You receive 2 improvement points to spend. These improvement points can be used to either increase 1 ability by 2 points or 2 abilities by 1 point each. Improvements spent in this way increase both the bonus and defense of an ability. Abilities cannot be increased beyond +10.

> Refer to [Knacks](Knacks) for other ways to advance.


## Retirement
At any point, an adventurer is allowed to retire, but this is typically done at 10th level.

Have the character express a fear and a hope for the future. Roll 2d6: On 10+, their hope comes true; 7-9, their fate is mixed. On a 2-6, they should expect the worst.

Their fate should be written on the back of their character sheet. The referee cannot use this character as an NPC against the party and the character cannot return to be played.
