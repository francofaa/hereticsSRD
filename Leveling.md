# Leveling
Characters level up to 10. The following table describes the total XP needed at each level: 

| Level | XP Total |
| ----- | -------- |
| 1     | 0        |
| 2     | 2,000     |
| 3     | 4,000     |
| 4     | 8,000    |
| 5     | 16,000    |
| 6     | 32,000   |
| 7     | 64,000   |
| 8     | 128,000   |
| 9     | 256,000  |
| 10    | 512,000  |

1. You receive 2 improvement points to spend. These improvement points can be used to either increase 2 abilities by 1 point each. Improvements spent in this way increase both the bonus and defense of an ability. Abilities cannot be increased beyond +10/20 def.
2. Hit protection: Roll a number of d8s equal to your new level. If the value is higher than your maximum HP, this is your new HP. If it is lower or equal, increase HP by 1. Add your strength bonus.

## Getting Experience Points

Primarily, experience points are exchanged for coins looted, stolen, or otherwise earned from adventuring (as opposed to found coins and coins earned from honest labor).

These exchanges take place during [downtime cycles](downtimecycle).

### Other Sources of Experience Points

Experience may also be rewarded by the referee for 

- finding clever solutions
- overcoming significant challenges
- winning over important allies
- finding clues to a mystery
- visiting or discovering an interesting settlement or point of interest

Experience is not recommended as a reward for "good role-playing" since this may put some players at a disadvantage if they are not comfortable speaking in-character. 

## Retirement

## Retirement

At any point, an adventurer is allowed to retire, but this is typically done at 10th level.

Have the character express a fear and a hope for the future. Roll 2d6: On 10+, their hope comes true; 7-9, their fate is mixed. On a 2-6, they should expect the worst.

Their fate should be written on the back of their character sheet. The referee cannot use this character as an NPC against the party and the character cannot return to be played.
