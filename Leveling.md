# Leveling

Characters level up to 10. The following table describes the total XP needed at each level: 

| Level | XP Total | Total Boons | Total Ability Points |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| 1     | 0        | 0           | 2                    |
| 2     | 2,000    | 1           | 4                    |
| 3     | 4,000    | 1           | 6                    |
| 4     | 8,000    | 2           | 8                    |
| 5     | 16,000   | 2           | 10                   |
| 6     | 32,000   | 3           | 12                   |
| 7     | 64,000   | 3           | 14                   |
| 8     | 125,000  | 4           | 16                   |
| 9     | 250,000  | 4           | 18                   |
| 10    | 500,000  | 5           | 20                   |

1. You receive 2 improvement points to spend. These improvement points can be used to increase 2 *different* abilities by 1 point each. Improvements spent in this way increase both the bonus and defense of an ability. Abilities cannot be increased beyond +10/20 def.
2. [Boons and graces](Boons)
	1. Every even level, choose a boon or a grace.
	2. Every odd level, you may choose to swap a boon for another, or barter a boon to receive grace.
3. Hit protection: Roll a number of d8s equal to your new level. If the value is higher than your maximum HP, this is your new HP. If it is lower or equal, increase HP by 1. 


## Experience Points

Experience points are gained for sacrificing treasures and coins to your [Source](Source). These must be treasures and coins looted, stolen, or otherwise earned from adventuring (as opposed to found coins and coins earned from honest labor). Sacrificing treasures and coins is done during [Sacrifices](downtimecycle#Sacrifices) during a downtime cycle.

### Other Sources of Experience Points

Experience may also be rewarded by the referee for 

- finding clever solutions
- overcoming significant challenges
- winning over important allies
- finding clues to a mystery
- visiting or discovering an interesting settlement or point of interest

Experience is not recommended as a reward for "good role-playing" since this may put some players at a disadvantage if they are not comfortable speaking in-character. 

## Retirement

At any point, a heretic is allowed to retire, but this is typically done at 10th level. If a player no longer wishes a heretic to be used, they may roll for their fate.

### Fate

Have the character express a fear and a hope for the future. Roll 2d6 + fate: On 10+, their hope comes true; 7-9, their fate is mixed. On a 2-6, they should expect the worst.

Calculate the fate modifier (which starts at 0) by referencing the tables below. Note the heretic's level and number of omens. The lowest fate modifier is -2. The highest is +2:

| Omens | Modifies Fate |
| ----- | -------- |
| 4+    | -1       |
| 1-3   | 0        |
| 0     | +1       |

| Level | Modifies Fate |
| ----- | ------------- |
| 1-5   | -1            |
| 6-9   | 0             |
| 10+    | +1            |

Their fate should be written on the back of their character sheet. The referee cannot use this heretic as an NPC against the party or be put in danger, and the heretic cannot return to be played as an NPC or PC.
