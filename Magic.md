# Magic

Magic is weird and dangerous. Everything magical is alive. Magical items exist but spells are also themselves live inside of magical artifacts. Magical wards can be used to protect against other magical effects and attacks. Medicinals (herbal magic) take the place of many abilities and spells traditionally associated with healer classes in class-based systems. 

To cast spells, mana dice are used, at times resulting in chaotic effects. Spells in the system are level-less.
