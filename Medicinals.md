## Medicinals
Components can be foraged and combined into medicinals. Refer to [Foraging for Components](wildernessexploration#Foraging%20for%20Components).

Monster parts may also be used to craft items, in coordination with the referee and may require appropriate checks. Intelligence check against a DC equal to 10 + monster HD may be appropriate. 

### Crafting 
The following table has substances along with their application, effects, and recipes. Solvents can include oils, water, honey. Creating medicinals takes 10 minutes. All medicinals are 5 to a slot. For example, "Poultice 5/5". Medicinals are created one for one.

For creatures afflicted by diseases, combinations of medicinals below may be used to treat diseases, where sensible.
