# Mishaps and Dooms

[Spell casting](spellcasting) is dangerous. Mishaps and dooms occur when doubles and triples are rolled on [Magic Dice](spellcasting#Magic%20Dice).

The referee should build out the mishaps and doom tables based on the aspects rolled and share these tables with the players. These should be marked on the [Party Tracker](PartyTracker) document. Any monster stats related to dooms should be hidden. 

All heretics can suffer from these mishaps and dooms. All heretics can cast spells.

## Doubles and Triples

If the caster rolls **doubles** on their magic dice, a magical mishap occurs with the spell behaving as written. If multiple doubles are rolled, the highest number takes precedence.

If the caster rolls **triples** on their magic dice, they receive 1 doom. The spell behaves as written. If multiple triples are rolled, only 1 doom is counted.

A mishap and a doom can occur on the same roll. 

The party's mishaps and doom tables are based on their [Source](Source#spellcasting-mishaps-and-dooms). Dooms are progressive and can be removed with quests. 

## Mishaps

Mishaps are the result of over-channeling power from the [Source](Source) (rather than a punishment from the Source).

The table below is a template for a mishap table. The values for 4-6 should be replaced by taking the first, second, and third rolled [Aspects](Source#Aspects) of the party's source and slotting them in where indicated.

| d6  | Mishap                                                             |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Magic *dice* only return to your pool on a 1-2 until the next dawn |
| 2   | Suffer 1d6 psychic damage                                          |
| 3   | Lose 1 magic die. Returns after 2 dawns.                           |
| 4   | *First aspect*                                                     |
| 5   | *Second aspect*                                                    |
| 6   | *Third aspect*                                                     |

Refer to your [Party Tracker](PartyTracker) and results of your [Aspects](Source#aspects) to determine your mishaps.

| Aspect               | Mishap                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fertility            | You make saves at disadvantage for *dice* rounds.                                                                                                                                         |
| Hearth and Home      | All close lights extinguish.                                                                                                                                                              |
| Revelry              | You become ravenously hungry and cannot cast spells again until you eat 1 ration. This does not count toward your rations for the day.                                                    |
| Seas and Rivers      | Water fills a sphere four times your size, magically suspended in the space. After *dice* rounds, the water gushes out.                                                                   |
| Weather              | A wind storm fills a sphere four times your size for *dice* rounds. Creatures in the area are immediately pushed *sum* feet away from you and are deafened by the noise for the duration. |
| Fortune              | The number *sum* becomes a critical failure for you when rolled on the d20. If *sum* is greater than 20, 20 is now a critical failure. This effect lasts until the next dawn.             |
| Healing and Medicine | All medicinals close to you instantly rot.                                                                                                                                                |
| Harvest              | All rations and food close to you instantly spoil.                                                                                                                                        |
| Death                | Your spirit escapes your body, which goes limp. As an action, you may make a +wil save vs 10 + *dice* to return to your body. Otherwise your spirit cannot interact with anything.        |
| Travel and Trade     | 10 x *sum* coins close to you disappear.                                                                                                                                                  |
| War                  | Every weapon attack against you has advantage for *dice* rounds.                                                                                                                          |
| Nature               | Plants and vines erupt from your hands and feet, entangling creatures nearby and close to you if they fail a +dex save vs your wil def. Plants go away in *dice* turns.                   |



## Dooms

Dooms are not punishments from the Source but interferences from other sources of magic, corrupting the Source's channel to the heretic. Count dooms as they accumulate. Doom level may be downgraded with quests or adventures. 

The party will have 3 doom tables based on their [Aspects](#aspects). The tripled number on the die corresponds to which table they will suffer the dooms from going forward: 

- 1-2: 1st aspect dooms
- 3-4: 2nd aspect dooms
- 5-6: 3rd aspect dooms

For example, if three 1's are rolled, the heretic will suffer the first doom from the 1st aspect table. Later, they roll three 6's. They still take their second doom from the 1st aspect table. This is because the dooms build on one another.

Below follows a doom table template. 

| Count | Dooms                                                  |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1st   | Mark 1 omen. +1 to casting the spell that caused doom. |
| 2nd   | +2 to casting the spell that caused doom.              |
| 3rd   |                                                        |


Each doom table for each possible Aspect follows below. 

### 1 Fertility 

| Count | Dooms                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1st   | You are haunted by visions of an abomination for *dice* rounds. You are stunned and unable to do anything else. Mark 1 omen. +1 to casting the spell that caused doom. |
| 2nd   | A parasite begins gestating somewhere inside you. +2 to casting the spell that caused doom.                                                                            |
| 3rd   | The parasite bursts from your body, and you are *bleeding out* (0 HP, +1 omen). It is hostile and hungry. Its HD is double your level.                                 |
