# Party

The party and the [Source](Source) are created first in order to establish the importance of the community and allow for the rotation of heretics in case of death, retirement, or the desire to run a roster of different characters.

The party should follow a single source. Followers of different sources can work together but this would require a separate tracking sheet for the source.
