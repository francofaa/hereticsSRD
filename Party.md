# Party

The party and the [Source](Source) are created first in order to establish the importance of the community and allow for the rotation of heretics in case of death, retirement, or the desire to run a roster of different characters. 

The party should follow a single source. Followers of different sources can work together but this would require a separate tracking sheet for the source.

The party should have a transparent document to track things that they share. 

- Shared [Inventory](Inventory): This can include a safe back at the hideout or a pack mule
- [Goons](Goons): Hirelings and retainers (and who commands them) should be recorded
- [Source](Source): Information about their source of power
- Magic dice pool, if [Coven Casting](spellcasting#Coven%20Casting): If heretics choose to use coven casting, they should remove the magic dice from their pool and mark them here. Only heretics following the same Source can coven cast. 
- Reputation with [Factions](Factions): Reputation with certain factions can be recorded qualitatively, along with any important historical notes. 

This party sheet should be player-facing and maintained by the party.
