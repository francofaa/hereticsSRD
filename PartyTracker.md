# Party Tracker

The referee and players may want to have a transparent document to track things that the heretics share. Note that not all of this information will be available right away.

- Shared [Inventory](Inventory): This can include a safe back at the hideout or a pack mule
- [Goons](Goons): Hirelings and retainers (and who commands them) should be recorded
- [Source](Source): Information about their source of power
- Magic dice pool, if [Coven Casting](spellcasting#coven-casting): If heretics choose to use coven casting, they should remove the magic dice from their pool and mark them here. Only heretics following the same Source can coven cast. Choosing a certain boon may sever a heretic from a coven.
- Reputation with [Factions](Factions): Reputation with certain factions can be recorded qualitatively, along with any important historical notes. 
- Mishaps and Dooms: The shared [Spellcasting Mishaps and Dooms](Source#spellcasting-mishaps-and-dooms) tables.
- Roster: Roster of all of the [Characters](Character) in play (and the players who play them).

If this party sheet is used, it should be player-facing and maintained by the party rather than the referee.
