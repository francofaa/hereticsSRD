# Patron God

The characters follow a patron god who is the font of their powers. The god can be named anything and does not have to be a god. It may be a spirit or a powerful magic-user or some unknowable creature from another dimension. Whatever it is, the characters worship it or try to appease it in order to keep their powers. 

## Aspects
Roll 3 times to build the god, re-rolling repeats, in order to create the god's 3 aspects.

## Symbols
The gods should have symbols. Roll as many times as is desired to create the symbols associated with the god. These should be treated as idea generators and may be (and should be) combined with one another.

Inspiration for symbols could also come from generators. Here is one such generator

## Ritual Sacrifices 
The god requires things of the characters for worship. In lieu of giving coins in exchange for experience points, the god may also accept two of the following: 

| d6    | Sacrifice                 |
| --- | ------------------------- |
| 1   | blood                     |
| 2   | charity (given to others) |
| 3   | animal sacrifice          |
| 4   | spoils of war             |
| 5   | spoils of the hunt        |
| 6   | food (farmed or foraged)  |

## Worship
The god requires worship once per week in the form of the following:

| d6  | Worship            |
| --- | ------------------ |
| 1   | silent prayers     |
| 2   | song               |
| 3   | commemorative art  |
| 4   | revelry            |
| 5   | complex ceremonies |
| 6   | sacrifice          |

## Places of Worship
The god, in days long dead, was worshipped in the following places

| d6    | Locations       |
| --- | --------------- |
| 1   | caverns         |
| 2   | groves          |
| 3   | bodies of water |
| 4   | mountain peaks  |
| 5   | buildings       |
| 6   | standing stones |


## Other considerations
Players may desire to make, or the characters may discover over the course of play, these additional characteristics of the god: 

- taboos
- rituals
- virtues 
- practices 
- prayers
- clergy 
- worldview
- creation myth 

## Sacrificing Treasures for XP

When the characters offer their treasures for sacrifice to their gods, they must each roll +wil during the ceremony versus a DC 12.

- If half or more of the characters pass, they receive a boon and a miracle; 
- if fewer than half pass, they receive a boon *or* a miracle, and the referee chooses a curse (on the lowest roller) or caprice, whichever is more interesting; 
- if all characters fail, all caprices occur and the lowest roller is cursed. 

- **Boon:** The highest roller chooses the character who receives the boon. Ties go to the player with the highest willpower and are ultimately broken by the referee. 
- **Miracle:** The community receives a miracle which may result in more converts

- **Curse:** The character has a -1 to all rolls of the god's type on the next adventure. The lowest roller always receives this. 
- **Caprice:** The community is inflicted by the caprices of the god which may result in worshippers losing their faith. 

No matter the outcome, the characters still receive their XP as normal.
