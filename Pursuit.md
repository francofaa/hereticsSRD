# Chase Mechanics

When fleeing a battle as a group (including retainers and hirelings), the player characters must describe how they flee the combat and the referee must provide the consequences of failure and success. Each player character must make a relevant saving throw depending on the scenario versus a DC equal to the pursuer's defense score of that skill, plus or minus any modifiers. Players should feel encouraged to drop traps and distractions to escape pursuers.

If all player characters fail their checks, the combat restarts, the enemies acting first with a surprise round.
