## Retainers
**Sample stat line:** HD1. HP 3(6). AD 13 (shield, helmet). MD 10. STR 1 DEX 1, INT 1, WIL 0. MV 120 (40). Att 1 x 1d6 (short sword) or 1 x spell. Items: Firebolt (spellbook).

A retainer's stats should be rolled ahead of time just like level 1 player character and populate the world. 

**Avoids:** Retainers will only follow player characters of a higher level than they are. Therefore level 1 characters cannot hire retainers. 

You can command retainers of HD up to your wil bonus. For example, a character with +2 wil may have one 2HD retainer or 2 1HD retainers.

**Role:** Everything a player character does. 

**Wages:** Retainers earn a half share of experience and treasure and can gain levels over time.

**Breaking points:** Half HP. Half of allies out.

**Availability:** Retainers can be found in any settlement. 

### Retainer Maneuvers
Rather than take an action, a character may instead issue a command for their retainers to follow a specific order as a unit. Otherwise, retainers will fight to survive. 

To issue a command, a commander must make a +wil roll against a DC equal to the total HD of monsters in a combat (rounded up) or 10, whichever is higher.

On a failure the retainers will continue to fight to survive, but on a success, a character may order the retainers to perform specific coordinated tactics. This could include

- Charging
- Kiting
- Focus fire
- Cutting off escape
- Retreat
- Perform a stunt (like grabbing an item or passing characters items)
- Forming a shield wall
