# Combat 

## Initiative 
The characters roll 1d6. On a 4 and above, the player characters go first; on a 3 and below, the enemy goes first. Creatures on each side go at the same time, deciding and declaring their actions together. Initiative is re-rolled every round. 

**Optional rule: Dex check against enemy dex score.** Alternatively each character must roll +dex against the dexterity defense of the enemy with the highest dexterity defense. Every character who rolls at or above that number goes ahead of the enemies, while every character who rolls under that number goes after the enemies. Initiative is not re-rolled. 

## Turns 
Turns consist of movements and actions and free actions. Reactions may also occur during the opposing turn when relevant. Movement away from an enemy does not provoke attacks of opportunity unless the enemy has a skill that says it does. 

Movement is 40 feet, typically. A single action may be performed which could be

- a melee or ranged attack
- reloading a crossbow 
- casting a spell (Refer to **Magic**)
- doing a stunt
- taking something out of your inventory
   - roll +dex versus the DC equal to the item's position in your inventory. On a success, you do the action for free and can take another action. On a failure, you retrieve the item anyway. 
- moving again
- intimidate (when the opposing side has half or fewer enemies left)
- give an order to retainers

Or anything else the referee may deem acceptable. 

### Attacking
Melee attacks may be made within 5-10 feet. Ranged attacks cannot be made within melee range. Make a melee or ranged attack by rolling 1d20 and adding the relevant bonus (usually str, but sometimes int or dex). If this value is equal to or over the enemy's armored defense score, the attack hits. The attacker then rolls the weapon's damage die. 

#### Sundering Attack 
Before rolling damage for a melee attack, a character may choose to destroy their weapon in order to inflict double the dice in damage. 

#### Improvised Damage
Unarmed strikes inflict damage equal to the strength bonus (minimum 0).

Physical damage from small things can be measured in d4 (caltrops, spikes, ball bearings--trip damage)

Physical damage from big things can be measured in d6 (carts, bookshelves, folding chairs)

Elemental damage can be measured in d6 (acid, fire, frost)

**Optional rule: Roll to defend.** If it is preferred to have all of the rolls player-facing, then when an enemy creature makes a melee or ranged attack, roll 1d20 + armored defense bonus against the defense of the ability the enemy is using. If they succeed, the attack misses. If they fail, the attack hits. 

### Morale checks
A player may request a morale check after certain breaking points: 

- A leader is killed 
- Half of their allies are killed 
- Half of their HP is reduced (if alone)
- Ambushed
- Attacked by something they fear

The requesting character must make a +wil check against the enemy leader's (or strongest remaining enemy's) willpower defense. On a success, the enemies surrender or rout; on a failure, the characters must wait for another breaking point to try again. 

### Retreating

A side may retreat on their turn. Choosing to retreat forces a check against the opponent's relevant defense, depending on the nature of the retreat. 

Concentration is broken and no other actions may be taken if a side chooses to retreat. On a successful retreat check, the character manages to escape. On a failed retreat check, they stop moving, unable to escape. Retreated characters move twice their speed in their chosen direction, as long as it is not through an enemy space. 

Any retainers or allies must make a wil save (morale) at disadvantage versus the strongest enemy's wil defense. On a failure, they rout and try to flee, often dying in the panic. 

#### Chase
1. Before anything else, a **pursued** may drop an item. If it is something a **pursuer** desires, roll willpower (morale) to see if the pursuer stops pursuit to take the item.
2. To flee or pursue, the party member with the lowest Dexterity in the party does an **opposed Dexterity save** against the enemy's Dexterity.
3. Find the difference between the rolled result and the Dexterity score. The player party gains that many "**steps**" if they succeed. The enemy gains that many "**steps**" if they succeed.
4. **A.** If the pursued are 5 steps ahead, they've lost the pursuers. If the player party has  
    successfully fled, check the enemy's morale to determine whether they search for the player party.  **B.** If the pursuers catch up to the pursued, the chase is over and the pursuers automatically win initiative.

Pursuit requires line of sight from the monster. If the characters are able to duck around a corner, the monster may avoid this combat. 

## Critical Hits
On a natural 20, an attack inflicts twice the dice in damage. On a natural 1, the attack may provide an opening to the opposing side, granting an advantageous position to the opposing side, unless it is mitigated by something else. 

## Advantage
Creatures gain advantage from advantageous situations, such as ambushes. 

When a creature has advantage, they may choose to perform a stunt and an attack at the same time. 

## Disadvantage 
Creatures suffer disadvantage from disadvantageous situations, such as being caught unawares or aiming at a creature that is behind partial cover. 

## Conditions
- Exhausted: Disadvantage on all rolls.
- Paralyzed
- Grappled: Speed is 0, disadvantage on all rolls except to break the grapple.
- Charmed: Acting friendly towards 
- Blind
- Deafened
- Stunned
