# Introduction
## Premise 
The characters are in a low magic world, secret followers of a heretical religion. 

## Principles

- **Danger is real.** Make a few characters to start with. Choosing combat is always the most dangerous option. 
- **Hit protection is not health. Health is health.** Your hit protection is divided into two: Grit and flesh. Flesh is your body, grit is your stamina, more or less. You can't swim across a pool of lava and quaff a health potion. Also, there are no health potions. Let's just get that out of the way.
- **Player ingenuity over character abilities.** As in real life, the only way to guarantee victory is with ingenuity, cunning, cleverness, planning, and overwhelming force. Luck is fickle and your modifiers aren't that good.
- **Magic is dangerous.** Mishaps will happen and dooms may occur. Spells are alive and live inside of objects. You can cast magic without artifacts and invent spells or magical effects on the fly but it's dangerous to be your own battery.
- **Level-less spells.** Spells are just spells and their power increases depending on how much power you imbue into it using mana dice.
- **No dump stats, no god stats.** There are only four ability scores (strength, dexterity, intelligence, and willpower) and they are set up in pairs (physical vs mental and offensive vs defensive). A spell-caster with high strength can carry more spell books, and a melee fighter with high willpower can command more retainers.
- **Your character is not the sheet.** If your ability score is low, it doesn't mean you have to roleplay it that way. It just means you have to prepare more to accommodate for the potential of failure. Avoid ever having to roll.
- **Offensive and defensive abilities.** You (almost) always attack with strength and intelligence and you have two static defense stats: Armored defense (dexterity modified by armor) and magicked defense (willpower modified by wards). Every ability has a defense and bonus and may require saves. And some situations may allow you to make physical attacks with intelligence or dexterity. 
- **But no classes, just inventory.** No classes means everyone can cast spells, swing swords, charm merchants, and walk across a tightrope. Knacks help characters specialize but ultimately, what you have is what you can do. And inventory management becomes important and is simplified with a slot mechanic. 
- **Travel and resources.** Journeying through the wilderness to get to the dungeon can be dangerous, and keeping fed will keep you alive and able to rest. 
- **Rounds, Turns, Watches.** Combat split into rounds with side-based initiative; dungeon exploration split into turns of 10 minutes to find traps, strategize, loot, investigate, and sneak; journeys split into 6 watches of 4 hours each for traveling, climbing, resting, foraging, and hunting.
- **Simpler monsters.** Monster stat blocks are stat lines, like in other OSR games and their difficulty level is determined by their hit dice (HD).
- **Failure.** Failure does not necessarily mean the character fails what they set out to do and should really never mean nothing happens. Because "nothing happens" is never the worst thing that could happen.
- **Play to find out what happens.** Let the players direct what they want to do. Be surprised and be their fan. Abide by the dice and roll out in the open, unless it would impact verisimilitude. 
- **The monsters know what they're doing.** The world is *real* and the creatures that inhabit it have their own desires and objectives. They may not always stand and fight to the death, they may be reasoned with, and they may try to conspire against (or with) the characters. 
- **Rulings over rules.** If at any time a rule is unclear or doesn't make sense or there is an argument over it, make a decision and move the game along, and put a pin in the rule and email me about it please. It's important to move the game along.
- **Move the game along.** Along with the above rule, also make sure that when a player character dies, that player has another character that can jump in quickly, even if it seems unlikely. Who cares. We all want to play and it sucks to sit on the sidelines for any amount of time. Whether it makes sense ("I was exploring this dungeon too!" "I've been looking everywhere for you!" "I was just a torch bearer but that PC's death made me gain a PC level and now I'm also here. Can I have their stuff?") or not ("I'm Hank's son, Hank 2, but just call me Hank"), just keep it moving. 

## Inspiration and Sources

To be fair, many of these games inspired each other, so I am only noting where I first encountered certain concepts:
- Arcane Ugly for mishaps and wands (and also a thanks for documenting the process of creating a TTRPG)
- Knave (this is mostly a hack of Knave)
- Goblin Laws of Gaming for mana dice and spells
- Five Torches Deep for supply, monster math, and charisma for retainers
- Cairn for spells
- Mausritter for inventory and spells as artifacts
- Stars Without Number for one-roll tables
- Maze Rats for name generators
- Apocalypse World and Monster of the Week for doomsday clocks, tags, and introducing me to playing to find out what happens
- DURF for being very similar to what I ended up making but only found toward the end of writing
- Ironsworn for retirement rules
- Old School Essentials for monster stats, generators, and dungeon exploration rules
- Morkborg for weird aesthetics, dungeons, and horrible artifacts 
- Ryuutama for travel rules
- The Monsters Know What They're Doing for general monster strategy
- Principia Apocrypha for principles 

This game is intended to be compatible with material written for OSR games.
