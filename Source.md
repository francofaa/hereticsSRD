# Source

The party receives their power from a Source, an unknowable entity. The Source can be named anything and does not have to be a deity. It may be a local spirit or a powerful or unknowable creature from another dimension. Whatever it is, the heretics worship it or try to appease it in order to keep their powers.

A Source is built by following the procedures below, in any order: 

1. Determine [Aspects](#aspects)
	- Determine [Blessings and Curses](#blessings-and-curses)
3. Determine [Preferred Sacrifice](#preferred-sacrifice)
4. Determine [Trappings](#trappings)
	- [Symbols](#symbols)
	- [Means of Devotion](#means-of-devotion)
	- [Communication](#communication)
5. Determine [Form](#form)

Name, appearance, and holidays can be determined at any point, but can be greatly informed by the results of the procedure. The facts of the Source should be recorded and maintained by the referee and players together.

### Blessings and Curses

These may be bestowed upon a heretic for whatever reason. Blessings and curses are associated with the Source's aspects. Curses impact the indicated ability by applying a -1 penalty for 1 day. 


## Preferred Sacrifice

The Source feeds on sacrifice from the heretics. The more followers sacrifice, the more it consumes. 

In order to [level up](Leveling), heretics must sacrifice their loot to their Source in exchange for experience points. Roll 1d6 twice on the table to find the Source's **most** and **least** preferred methods of sacrifice. 

When loot is spent on the most preferred sacrifice, the heretic receives 1.25 times the experience in exchange for the loot. When loot is spent on the least preferred sacrifice, the heretic receives 0.75 times the experience in exchange for the loot.
