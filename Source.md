# Source

The party receives their power from a Source, an unknowable entity. The Source can be named anything and does not have to be a deity. It may be a spirit or a powerful or unknowable creature from another dimension. Whatever it is, the characters worship it or try to appease it in order to keep their powers. 

A Source is built by the following procedure: 

1. Determine [Aspects](#Aspects)
2. Determine [Spellcasting Mishaps and Dooms](#Spellcasting%20Mishaps%20and%20Dooms)
3. Determine [Preferred Sacrifice](#Preferred%20Sacrifice)
4. Determine [Trappings](#Trappings)
	1. [Symbols](#Symbols)
	2. [Means of Devotion](#Means%20of%20Devotion)
	3. [Communication](#Communication)
5. Determine [Form](#Form)

Name and appearance can be determined at any point. 

## Aspects

Roll d12 three times to build out the aspects of the Source, re-rolling repeats:

| 11  | War                  | DEX   | Today, whenever you inflict damage, add 1d4 of the same damage type.                      | Every weapon attack against you has advantage for *dice* rounds.                                                                                                                 | 1: You are unable to use a weapon or cast a spell for one day. 2: Armor and weapons become heavy for you.

### Blessings

These may be bestowed upon a heretic for whatever reason. These are separate from [Boons](Boons) and [Omens](Damage#Omens). Blessings and curses are associated with the aspects in the table. Curses impact the indicated ability by applying a -1 penalty to the ability for 1 day. 

### Out of Favor

When a heretic is at odds with their Source, the heretic no longer benefits from the boons gained through leveling. They must either reconcile (via a quest of some sort) or make a pact with a different Source to gain more boons. 

## Spellcasting Mishaps and Dooms

Build out the mishaps and dooms tables as you create the aspects and mark them down on the [Party](Party) document. All heretics will suffer from these mishaps and dooms. All heretics can cast spells.

Mishaps occur when doubles are rolled on magic dice. Dooms occur when triples are rolled on magic dice. Refer to [Spellcasting](spellcasting) for more information. This section describes how to build these tables.

### Mishaps Table

Mishaps should be narrated as the result of overchanneling power from the Source, not as a punishment. 

Build a table by taking the first, second, and third rolled [Aspects](#Aspects) of the party's source and slotting it in where indicated.

| d6  | mishap                                                                          |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Magic dice only return to your pool on a 1-2 until the next dawn                |
| 2   | Suffer 1d6 psychic damage                                                       |
| 3   | *First aspect*                                                                  |
| 4   | *Second aspect*                                                                 |
| 5   | *Third aspect*                                                                  |
| 6   | Spell targets you (if harmful) or enemy (if beneficial) or fizzles (if neutral) |

### Dooms Tables

The party will have 3 doom tables based on their [Aspects](#Aspects). The tripled number on the die corresponds to which table they will suffer the dooms from going forward: 

- 1-2: 1st aspect dooms
- 3-4: 2nd aspect dooms
- 5-6: 3rd aspect dooms

For example, if three 1's are rolled, the heretic will suffer the first doom from the 1st aspect table. Later, they roll three 6's. They still take their second doom from the 1st aspect table. This is because the dooms accumulate thematically.

Dooms should not be narrated as punishments from the Source but as interference from other sources of magic, corrupting the Source's channel to the heretic. Count dooms as they accumulate. 

| Count | dooms                                                            |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1st   | Mark 1 omen. +1 to *sum* and casting for spell that caused doom. |
| 2nd   | +2 to *sum* and casting for spell that caused doom.              |
| 3rd   |                                                                  |

Dooms may be downgraded with quests or adventures. 

## Preferred Sacrifice

The Source feeds on sacrifice from the heretics. The more followers sacrifice, the more it consumes. 

In order to [level up](Leveling), heretics must sacrifice their loot to their Source in exchange for experience points. Roll 1d6 twice on the table to find the Source's **most** and **least** preferred methods of sacrifice. 

When loot is spent on the most preferred sacrifice, the heretic receives 1.25 times the experience in exchange for the loot. When loot is spent on the least preferred sacrifice, the heretic receives 0.75 times the experience in exchange for the loot.

## Trappings
