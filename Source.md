# Source

The party receives their power from a Source, an unknowable entity. The Source can be named anything and does not have to be a deity. It may be a spirit or a powerful or unknowable creature from another dimension. Whatever it is, the characters worship it or try to appease it in order to keep their powers. 

A Source is built by the following procedure: 

1. Determine [Aspects](#Aspects)
2. Determine [Preferred Sacrifice](#Preferred%20Sacrifice)
3. Determine [Trappings](#Trappings)
	1. [Symbols](#Symbols)
	2. [Means of Devotion](#Means%20of%20Devotion)
	3. [Communication](#Communication)
4. Determine [Form](#Form)

Name and appearance can be determined at any point.

### Blessings and Curses

These may be bestowed upon a heretic for whatever reason. These are separate from [Boons](Boons) and [Omens](Damage#Omens). Blessings and curses are associated with the aspects in the table. Curses impact the indicated ability by applying a -1 penalty to the ability for 1 day. 


### Out of Favor

When a heretic is at odds with their Source, the heretic no longer benefits from the boons gained through leveling. They must either reconcile (via a quest of some sort) or make a pact with a different Source to gain more boons. 

## Preferred Sacrifice

The Source feeds on sacrifice from the heretics. The more followers sacrifice, the more it consumes. 

In order to [level up](Leveling), heretics must sacrifice their loot to their Source in exchange for experience points. Roll 1d6 twice on the table to find the Source's **most** and **least** preferred methods of sacrifice. 

When loot is spent on the most preferred sacrifice, the heretic receives 1.25 times the experience in exchange for the loot. When loot is spent on the least preferred sacrifice, the heretic receives 0.75 times the experience in exchange for the loot.
