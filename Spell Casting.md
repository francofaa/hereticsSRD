# Spell Casting
*Casting spells is dangerous.* 

Spells must be cast holding the spell item in two hands. When casting a spell, roll a number of **mana dice** up to your +int bonus plus 1 and, where applicable, a +int attack roll. 

## Spell Tags
- **Line of sight.** Unless otherwise specified by the spell, the spell requires line of sight on the target
- **D:** Duration. Spells with ongoing effects will be denoted as such. This is also where concentration will be denoted. 
- **R:** Range of spells, as a distance.
- **T:** The target(s) of the spell. 
- **\[dice\]** means the number of mana dice rolled. 
- **\[sum\]** means the sum of the mana dice rolled. 
- **Attack.** This refers to whether a spell requires a spell attack. This requires a d20+int attack against the target's magicked defense.
- **Save.** This refers to whether a spell requires a save from the target and specifies the ability. For +wil saves, the target uses their magicked defense bonus instead. The DC is always equal to the caster's intelligence defense. 
- **Concentration**. Some spells require concentration to maintain. If a spellcaster is attacked or performs an action other than maintaining concentration on the spell, the spell's effect ends. 

## Mana Dice
Mana dice are a pool of d6 equal to your 1+int bonus, minimum 0. Count the number of mana dice rolled and sum the total as well. Spells' features may depend on the number of dice rolled and the sum, or both, or neither. 

Mana dice are rolled in conjunction with spell attack dice, when applicable. Roll them all at once because even if the attack fails or only inflicts half damage or a weakened effect on the target, the results will still have a material impact. 

### Expending and Recovering Mana Dice
On a 1-3, the mana die returns to your pool. On a 4-6, the caster must have a long rest. The mana die returns at dawn. 

#### Wards as Mana Dice
Wards can also be used to contribute mana dice (1 for 1) and are destroyed on a roll of 4-6 and cannot be recovered. The ward is unaffected on a 1-3. When using a ward as a mana die, separate the roll by using a different color die or rolling it first or last, separately from the other dice. 

### Mishaps and Dooms
If the caster rolls **doubles** on their dice, a magical mishap occurs with the spell. 

If the caster rolls **triples** on their dice, they receive 1 doom. 

Mishaps may be avoided by destroying a **ward.** Dooms may be avoided by destroying **three wards**.

| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Mana dice only return to your pool on a 1-2 until the next dawn                                             |
| 2   | Suffer 1d6 psychic damage                                                                                   |
| 3   | Random mutation for 1d6 rounds. Roll a +wil save against your own int defense or the mutation is permanent  |
| 4   | Blind, deafened, stunned, or in agony for 1d6 rounds                                                        |
| 5   | Ravenous hunger: Cannot cast spells or attack until you eat 1 ration. Does not count for your daily ration. |
| 6   | Spell targets you (if harmful) or enemy (if beneficial) or fizzles (if neutral)                             |

Count dooms as they accumulate.

| 1st | Drop to 0 grit.                                                                             |
| 2nd | Lose the ability to cast spells for 3 days.                                                 | 
| 3rd | The spell escapes the artifact and you are trapped in the artifact now. You become a spell. |

### Coven Casting
With a magical ritual and symbols (like string tied around fingers, rings, tattoos, etc), characters may be bound together and **share** mana dice in a single pool. 

## Wild Magic
When casting magic, never be your main battery. Always use a buffer like a spellbook, artifact, focus, etc. 

But if you must: You may use mana dice as a way to tap into the wild magic of the world. Describe an effect and choose a target, and the referee should adjudicate the results, which will be hazardous and may not work as expected, and mishaps and dooms will still apply as well and may become even worse. 

## Spells 
Spells live inside artifacts, spellbooks, relics, tablets, and mundane items. Spells take up 1 inventory slot and usually do not require attunement.
