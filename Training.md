# Training 

During a [downtime cycle](downtimecycle), characters may choose to make progress on learning, study, and training. 

## Learning a Trade

Learning a certain trade from an instructor costs time, training, and coin. 

Choose a [background](charactercreation#Gear) trade or make up a background with the referee. The player and referee should agree to what abilities the character will receive upon the various stages of training.

The character rolls 1d20 + a relevant ability and compares the result to the table below. The character may attempt 1 training session per downtime cycle.

| 1d20  | Result                                           |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 16-20 | Training is successful: Advance to next level.   |
| 10-15 | Next downtime cycle, the training is successful. |
| 0-9   | No progress is made during training.                                                 |

To reach each level of expertise, an appropriate instructor must be found and hired, the training session paid for, and the appropriate number of *successful* training sessions to be completed. 

To reach the level of a legend in the trade, the referee may require specific quests to be completed. 

| Level        | Coin per Training Attempt | Successful Training Sessions |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Novice       | 1,000                     | 1                            |
| Professional | 2,000                     | 2                            |
| Master       | 4,000                     | 3                            |
| Legend       | n/a                       | n/a                          |

## Training Knacks

Rather than acquiring [Knacks](Knacks) through the expenditure of ability points upon leveling, a character can train a knack. 

Learning a knack from an instructor costs time, training, and coin. 

The character rolls 1d20 + a relevant ability and compares the result to the table below. The character may attempt 1 training session per downtime cycle.

| 1d20  | Result                                           |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 16-20 | Training is successful.                          |
| 10-15 | Next downtime cycle, the training is successful. |
| 0-9   | No progress is made during training.             |

A character must succeed three times to acquire the knack, spending 1,000 coins per attempt. If the character fails three times in total, they are refused further training. Another instructor must be found and the process must start all over. 

## Animal Training

Training animals requires time, successful trainings, and coin. 

The character rolls 1d20 + wil and compares the result to the table below. The character may attempt 1 training session per downtime cycle.

| 1d20  | Result                                           |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 16-20 | Training is successful.                          |
| 10-15 | Next downtime cycle, the training is successful. |
| 0-9   | No progress is made during training.             |


All but domesticated animals must be tamed before being trained to obey a special command. Once tamed, an animal will obey commands per their stat line and they may be treated as retainers (without counting toward the retainer number).

If the character fails three times in a row to tame or train an animal, that animal cannot be tamed or trained to follow that special command. 

| Category               | Sessions to Tame | Sessions to Train | Coin Cost per Session |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Domesticated           | 0                | 1                 |   100                    |
| Feral                  | 1                | 1                 |      200                 |
| Wild                   | 2                | 2                 |     400                  |
| Monstrous/Supernatural | 3                | 3                 |        1,000               |
