# Wilderness Exploration

## Watches
Days are split up into 6 watches (about 3 in the day and 3 in the night), each 4 hours long. 

A navigator should be declared. 

## Traveling
Characters move 6 miles per watch (4 hours).

Movement is halved through difficult terrain, in darkness, and in bad weather. Movement is doubled when riding a mount or going solely by road. 

### Forced March
Traveling longer than 3 watches (12 hours) requires a +str save of DC 15 per additional watch or suffer 1 point of direct damage (to flesh). 

### Navigation
Navigator determines direction and navigates. The referee rolls that character's +int as necessary (determined by table below). If the characters have an accurate map, this is also not necessary:

| Navigation                                                     | DC       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Road, open sea with land in sight                              | No check |
| Grassland, coast, plains, farmland                             | 5        |
| Arctic, desert, hills, open sea with clear skies               | 10       |
| Forest, jungle, swamp, mountains, open sea with overcast skies | 15       |
| Any region with white-out precipitation                        | +3       |

#### Failed Navigation
On a failed navigation check, the referee should roll 1d10 in secret. 

| d10  | Direction               |
| ---- | ----------------------- |
| 1-4  | veered into left hex    |
| 5-6  | arrived in intended hex |
| 7-10 | veered into right hex   |



## Activities
Characters can spend a full watch in a 30 square mile area (6 mile hex) in order to forage or explore. 

### Exploring 
Players spending time exploring find points of interest that wouldn't be identified while traveling right through a hex. 

### Foraging  
Characters may forage and hunt for food. This requires a +int check depending on the environment. Such a check may also be impossible in certain environments. 

| Foraging                                    | DC  |
| ------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Abundant food and water sources             | 10  |
| Limited food and water sources              | 15  |
| Very little, if any, water and food sources | 20  |


A successful roll yields 1d6 worth of food. Food is maximum 2 per slot.

#### Foraging for Components

Rather than hunting for food, characters may search for components for medicinals. Search as above, but on a success, roll 1d12 per +int bonus. Roll 1d4 for each, receiving that amount. 

All components are a maximum of 5 per slot.
