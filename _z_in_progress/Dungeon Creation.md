# Dungeon Generation Procedure

## 1 What was it and what is it?

Roll once for original purpose of the dungeon. Roll again for current purpose.

1. Prison / Asylum
2. Palace
3. Fortress
4. Temple
5. Museum
6. Workshop
7. Archive / Library
8. Cloister / Monastery
9. Mine
10. Cavern / Sinkhole 
11. Sewer / Canals
12. Tomb / Crypt / Catacombs
13. Maze
14. Observatory
15. Zoo / Greenhouse / Aviary
16. Gargantuan Corpse
17. Vault 
18. House
19. Tower
20. Settlement / Hideout

## 2 What made this a dungeon?

What happened to this location to make it what it is today?

1. Arcane disaster
2. Resource drain
3. Natural disaster
4. Extraplanar disaster
5. Infection / Infestation 
6. Intentional destruction

Complications below can also be added or derive from the origins above to add a ticking clock when needed. These complications can be natural, magical, or caused by a monster. 

1. Collapses / Moving walls and floors
2. Caustics: Lava, acid, fire
3. Infections: Diseases, poisons, vegetation
4. Flooding: Water, sand, non-Newtonian fluids
5. Air quality
6. Magical effects: Planeshifting, magical darkness, wild magic, reverse gravity

## 3 Who lives here?

Find someone to talk to who is not (initially) hostile.

1. Rival adventuring party
2. Ancient denizen (cursed person, ghost)
3. Prisoner
4. Researcher
5. Lost person
6. Sentient object

Populate the dungeon with up to two factions. Create them as follows

First create their impulses:
- Hunters: Victimize vunerable people 
- Feeders: Consume other people's resources
- Enforcers: Tamp down divergence 
- Family: Protect the family and hide secrets 
- Mob: Destroy and scapegoat
- Cult: Victimize and absorb

Populate the dungeon with unique monsters

==TK==

## 4 What can be found here?

There should be multiple goals and sources of loot within a dungeon but focusing on a single major reward will help guide the action and provide incentive for moving through. 

1. Coins, jewels, relics
2. Information, lore, hooks
3. Friendship / ally
4. Trade goods
5. Improved gear, spells
6. Property, favors


## 5 What rumors and hooks emit from this dungeon?

Based on the information gathered so far, create a table of rumors and hooks about this dungeon that could be used to hook players into wanting to explore it. 

For rumors, make a 1d6 table, with 1-3 being truths, 4-5 being partial truths, and 6 being untrue. 

For hooks, make a 1d4 table containing some results in the following categories: 

- Patronage: An NPC requests something 
- Offer: Bounty is available or roll for rumors
- Confrontation: Factions from the dungeon or situations coming out of the dungeon confront the characters directly 

Some may be duplicated for a higher likelihood of occurrence.

You may twist one as well, misleading the characters about one of the following: 
- the situation
- Course of action to do 
- Motives
- Some or all of the above 


## 6 What is the structure of the dungeon?

Roll 1d12 for dungeon cycles to determine what exists between the major reward and the first entrance to the dungeon. 





## Three Step Tool 
1. Concept 1
2. Concept 2
3. Challenge with both concepts




## Secrets


## Dungeon Tricks

## Dungeon Hazards

## Traps


### Triggers

### Effects




## Deadly Element

Add a deadly element. Use it as a black door. 

- Label it as such 
- Provide a manner of escape 

## Something to Experiment With and Expand the World

https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/01/dungeon-checklist.html

Try a spell table and mess with some effects to get something out of it; include a die roll to randomize where the effect is (or maybe it is the cataclysm effecting the dungeon)

Something unsolved and weird so you can play around with it 


## 6 room clusters

Roll for 3 6 room clusters. They should connect. The first two should have entrances. The first two should have separate challenge themes. The third should connect those two themes.
