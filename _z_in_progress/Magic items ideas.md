# Magical Items
Magical items require attunement. Attuning requires 1 uninterrupted hour of contemplation with the object to be attuned. Attuned items must be in the attuned character's inventory in order to be used.

## Weapons 
Note that weapons of different materials (silver, gold, obsidian) are not magical unless specified to be magical. 

- Blink blade: As a free action, this weapon can be summoned into your hand. 
- Resonance blade: Every attack makes a ringing sound audible for 25'. On a successful hit with this weapon, the target must make a +str save vs str def or be pushed 10' away or knocked prone, wielder's choice. Alternatively, a creature 5' away from the target may be hit with the sound wave and suffer 1d4 thunder damage.
- Stone dagger: +1 to attack. Creature that is struck with this is turned to the stone. Removing dagger instantly brings them back to life. Embedding the dagger into a creature requires a +int or +dex attack.
- Heartseeker bow: +1 to attack.
- Heartseeker arrows: 5/5. A magical glass-tipped arrow that drains blood from a creature on a hit from the Heartseeker bow. A command word can be used to drain the blood from the glass tip and restore 1d8 flesh or grit.
- Night Blade. +3 to attack. It can only be drawn at night. 
- Shifting Weapon. This weapon can change form. The two forms are determined with the referee and can be changed as a free action. 
- Dead Eye Bow. When you hit with this weapon, you may make a second attack with the same weapon at advantage. You may use this ability 3 times, recharging at dawn.
- Bonecrusher. +1 warhammer. With this weapon, your critical range expands by 1 on each side. This means you critically succeed on a 20 and 19 and critically fail on a 1 and 2. Additionally, if your critical range is already expanded (like if you have a knack that grants critical hits on a 19), you also get critical hits on an 18, but you also critically fail on a 2. On a critical hit, this weapon does an additional 2d12 damage. On a critical miss, this weapon is embedded in a surface and requires an action to remove.
- Elemental weapon. Inflicts an additional 2d6 damage on a hit of the element. May have an additional environmental effect depending on the element type. 
- Elemental resistance armor. Armor that grants resistance to a particular element type. 
- Binder of the Dead. Deals an additional 1d12 necrotic damage. When you hit a spectral creature or a creature that is not yet dead, you absorb a part of their soul. If the hit would kill a living creature or destroy an undead spectral creature, your blade absorbs their soul. They speak to you at night.

## Magic Focuses 
You may only wield one of these at a time. 
- Eye of the Witchking: Remove your own eye and insert this eye. It is blackened with a red pupil. The wearer permanently has an additional 3 mana dice. Doom: The caster becomes an undead creature, under the sway of the Witchking. 
- Witch's Crystal Ball: If you would lose an innate mana die on a roll, keep it instead. You may use this ability 3 times, recharging at dawn. This may be spread across a single cast or multiple casts. 
- Ash Wand: You gain 3 mana dice, which do not recharge.
- Crooked Staff: Negate a mishap or reduce a doom to a mishap once per spell. This ability may be used 3 times, recharging at dawn. 
- Birch Wand: You gain 1 mana die, which does not recharge. 
- Maple Wand: You gain 2 mana die, which do not recharge. 

## Objects of Power
- Spell Eater. A figurine of a human with an unnaturally large smile. This object grants 3 mana dice which can only be used to cast Spell Eater: Feed a curse, spell, or other ill effect to the Spell Eater as a reaction or action. Curse: This item cannot be unattuned. Doom: Summons the Spell Eater.
- Oubliette key. Key adorned with a screaming face. Opening any door with this key leads the user into a 10 x 10 stone room, which can only be opened from the outside. Has 24 hours of air.
- Toxic heart. Must replace your heart. If a creature tries to drink your blood, it suffers 3d6 direct damage. If you are down to 0 grit points, any melee attacks inflict 1d6 direct damage as your blood touches the attacker. Anyone trying to heal you must make a +str save vs your wil def or suffer 1d6 direct damage as they touch your wounds.
- Bleeding scalpel. Can turn blood into a magical rope. The wielder can drain their own blood and weave it into a red rope. The rope is non-animate but will un-knot on command. It counts as magical, which means it could be used to, for instance, strangle a Ghost. Rope is 30ft long per flesh sacrificed.
- Fishing spear: always hits a fish in a lake 
- Red blindfold: lets you see heartbeats in splashes of red but otherwise your vision becomes black and white lines 
- Steel rope. Rope that becomes rigid as steel on command, using an action. 
- Two headed silver rings: communication rings, spoken in whispers
- Flash orb: a light source, emitting bright light in 30'. If dropped, it explodes and blinds all creatures within 30' for 1d6 rounds. The flash orb magically restores itself at the end of the 1d6 rounds but no longer emits light. It emits light again at dawn. 
- Death mask: stolen from a priest's sarcophagus. Placing it on a corpse lets you see the cause of death 
- Noose. 10 feet of rope that can be solidly affixed to an object. A command word fuses and separates the noose end from the object.
- Cinder. Can provide warmth and/or light at *close* range using a command word.
- Axe. A thirsting blade that inflicts 2d8. Once a victim is killed, the blade seeks another victim. Make a +wil save vs 15 to stop from attacking someone you do not want to. The blade speaks to whoever is holding it.
- Nails. Embedded nails can be used as magnets to draw metal objects toward you. When you speak the command word, 
- Healing blade. Can be used to heal cuts for 2d8 grit and stabilizes any creature. After being used to heal, it reverts to a normal dagger until dawn.

- Folding boat. A folding boat that can carry 6 medium creatures. 
- Pal Pipes. A pan flute that can only be heard by allies with a 300' radius.
- Grim Gauntlet. ad+1 1h. When a melee attack would hit, you may use a reaction to force a +str save against your str def. On a failed save, the attacker misses and you seize their weapon. This ability can be used 3 times, recharging at dawn.
- Whispering Ring. A ring that does not belong to you. When you cast a spell, you may add up to 6 mana dice. These should be rolled separately and do not inflict mishaps or dooms. Curse: When you use this ability, you lose 1 third of your flesh points, rounded up, permanently. This cannot be reversed. On the third use, you lose all of your flesh points and immediately become a wraith. You cannot unattune from this item and it cannot be taken off your finger.

## Wards
Wards are protective magical items. 

Only wards can be broken to nullify the effects of a spell on the wielder (and only the wielder). Other magical items do not have this ability, unless specified. For example, if a fireball is cast in an area and the target has a ward that they wish to break as a reaction to avoid all damage from the fireball, they may do so; however, anyone or anything else in that area of effect is still affected. Basically, this is not a free counterspell but a magical bubble. 

Wards can also nullify the effects of mishaps and dooms.

Wards must be attuned to.

- Fetish, wooden spoon, chain, charm, scapular: md+1 at
- Glass eye (worn): You can see through illusions. md+2 at. 
- Vial of holy water: begins boiling if an undead creature is within 60'. md+2 at
