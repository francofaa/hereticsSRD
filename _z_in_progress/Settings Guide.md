# Setting: Isurholm, Former Werriadi Colony
After 1,000 years, the Werriadi Empire has fallen. Its territory spread beyond the Werriadi peninsula, all over the Great Sea, dominating politics in the lands of Ereb, the northern coast of the lands of Afir, and the western parts of Hesiona, previously ruled by the Mineosi Empire. 

A lonely colony of the Werriadi on the island Isurholm was abandoned 400 years ago, 100 years before the empire's final collapse. The grand Werriadi cities were destroyed. The only thing uniting the successor realms of the Werriadi Empire is the former state's religion, Emalism, the worship of Emal, the incarnation of the Unseen who was executed by the Werriadi and reborn. The cult spread after the Werriadi Emperor was converted and the religion was evangelized to distant lands by its followers.

Isurholm is established on the southern part of the island after the Isuri crossed the Northern Straits and conquered the remnants of Werriadi subjects that remained.

A successor state of the Werriadi, Gallika, is across the Northern Straits on the Ereb continent. You are a native of this state. 

After getting caught practicing witchcraft by the Emalist Church authorities, you are banished to the island of Alfia, to an abbey on the edge of the wilderness that has, in the intervening 400 years, overtaken the old Werriadi colony. 

Isurholm, originally called Otyde, was first settled by what the Otani call the Disirlings, ancient giants. 

Piastro, a nation on Ereb across the sea, has a large trading network. By tradition, they claim descent from the Disirlings.

Beneath the water, --- not sure if there is a hallucinated goat foot under the water 

A single six mile hex for the adventure: dungeon beneath the abbey to journey through


Bees, hothouses, brewery, scriptorium, herb house, orchard




- Aegerlings: Invaders from over the sea (exonym) / / also called Outlanders / endonym is Attalander / they come from Attaland
- Otani: "Foreigners", original inhabitants of the island of Isurholm (they call it Galolis)
- Isuri: inhabitants, descended from old invaders / Galoli (exonym, means foreigner, which the Otani call them)
- Disirlings: The ancient forerunners who first conquered Isurholm, thought to be giants (called themselves the Disiri)
- Piastro: The nation across the sea, descendants of the Disiri


You have to have a reason to return home at some point but you are forced to after the catastrophe happens to you 


Christianity like religion, demands obedience

Druidic religions (Otani, very few of them, most of them have converted to the dead god)
- Aegerlings: Amfris-who-flies-above, war god, plus a fertility god

Blacksmith often makes deal with the devil : they extract steel from stone ; sick people were taken to their anvils ; some blacksmiths were canonized 



# Build a Setting 

Tell us about the town 

Limit backgrounds, turn on encumbrance, draw the town, let the heroes come up with their own ideas for the town and the type of people that live there, make a map of the region (godsbody through to Gomotesc)

Choose the season the game starts in; it takes a full season to gather supplies, money, to make an expedition to each of the dungeons so the heroes have to choose when they go to a certain place. There will be separate seasonal occasions as the heroes start trying to learn how to use their powers (leveling up) and figure out what kind of people live in the village, their relationships, and the invasions of interlopers

They must all return to their hometown

You must all be human warlocks, but you start as commoners as we determine the hometown you are all from. 

- Why did you leave home? What did you hope to find?
- How did the townspeople learn of your worship?
- How did they try to kill you?


a monster, its lair, and itâ€™s most recent victim

you bear a scar and a memento 

Religious organization is coming to your hometown next (they are a violent mercenary group that is disguised as religion, Christian like): you have to collect the artefacts to prepare for their arrival; it has been foretold by your deity 

whatever subclass of warlock you choose, think about how the gift supersedes some failing you have already. For example, if you choose hexblade, maybe your character is physically weak or sickly. 

God becomes more powerful the more stuff you find and get for it; you have to make material sacrifices; establish what your god does first and then it begins to branch into other areas

subclasses, one apiece ; use the witches in those pics 

you'll get to make your background and your origin, but your heroic origin will be role-played. 



---- 
Information that the heroes have about the world is imperfect. 

- River communities (rivers systems are transpo highways)
- Aquifers and water sources
- Mining, ores
- Fossil fuels
- Leyline intersections
- Magic crystal mines
- Magic mushroom forests

How do these interact? For instance, a wizard builds a tower that threatens a druid's grove 

Add adventure sites and settlements in equal numbers. For each settlement, consider 
- trade 
- craft 
- commodity 
- unusual beliefs 
- unique things 

Examples would include tulip / orchid market, people taking a siesta every day. 

With each location, start with a bad status quo.
