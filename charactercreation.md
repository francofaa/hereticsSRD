> Refer also to module [level zero start](levelzerostart) for alternate rules for character generation.

## 1. Ability Score Generation 
Character abilities are 
1. Strength
2. Dexterity
3. Intelligence
4. Willpower

All ability bonuses start at 0. Add 10 to get that ability's defense. 

To generate ability scores, you may either

- Add 3 ability points to any of your ability bonuses. Subtract 1 from one of your ability bonuses. Add 10 to each ability to get its defense. For example, a strength bonus of +2 is a strength defense of 12. 
- Roll 1d4 three times. Each time, add +1 to an ability according to its order above. 1=Strength, 2=Dexterity, 3=Intelligence, 4=Willpower. Then roll 1d4 once. Subtract 1 from the ability that is rolled. You may then swap 2 ability bonus scores.This can also be done randomly by rolling 4d4, adding 1 for the first three rolls and subtracting one for the last roll, determining which stat is increased/decreased by assigning the numbers one through four, in order, to Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Willpower. You may then swap 2 ability bonus scores. 
	- For example: The first d4 lands on a 3, so Intelligence is increased by 1. The second lands on a 4, so Willpower increases by 1. The third lands on 3 again, so Intelligence is increased by 1. The last lands on 1, so Strength is *decreased* by 1. The array ends with Strength=-1, Dexterity=0, Intelligence=2, Willpower=1.

Possible starting arrays, not taking into account position of abilities, are as follows.

1. 3, 0, 0, -1
2. 2, 1, 0, -1
3. 2, 0, 0, 0
4. 1, 1, 0, 0
5. 1, 1, 1, -1

Refer to [Abilities](Abilities) for more information.

## 2. Secondary Ability Generation

Your secondary abilities are derived as follows:

- Strength
	- Maximum inventory = defense score (Refer to [Items](Items) for inventory limitations)
- Dexterity
	- Armored defense = defense score, plus any armor (Refer to [Martial Gear](MartialGear) for armor)
- Intelligence
	- Maximum supply = defense score (Refer to [Supply](Supply) module)
	- Mana Dice = bonus score + 1 (Refer to  module)
- Willpower
	- Maximum attuned items = bonus score (Refer to [Magic](Magic) module)
	- Maximum retainers = bonus score (Refer to [Hirelings](Hirelings) module)
	- Warded defense = defense score, plus any wards

Movement is 40 feet of combat movement and 120 feet of exploration movement.

## 3. Grit and Flesh Point Generation 

Hit protection is split into grit and flesh. Roll 1d8 to find your grit total. 

You may also roll 1d8 rerolling 1's and 2's or 2d4 to determine the initial grit.

Roll 1d4 to determine initial flesh total. 

Refer to [Damage](Damage) for more on grit and flesh. 

## 4. Background Starting Gear
You start with 1 or 2 backgrounds which also inform what you start with on your person. These are failed professions that you endeavored before becoming an adventurer, so treat them as such. 

Roll 1d8 and 1d6 and cross reference the numbers to find your background. Roll the two dice again to get your second background. You get all the gear from each background.

> For non-human species, if they are allowed in the campaign, refer to the [other species](otherspecies). This may replace one of the backgrounds or be an addition to the backgrounds. Consult with your referee before doing this.

Actions performed using skills or tools relevant to a character's background may not require a roll to resolve or may be given some bonus based on the referee's discretion.

## 7. Name
Choose or roll on a naming table. For the Isurholm setting, there is a [names table](namestables) available.


## Reading a Stat Line
All creatures can be expressed in a single stat line. 

1. L# or \#HD: Indicates level for a player character or retainer / hit dice for monsters
2. HP #(#): Indicates hit points. Parenthetical number represents flesh points, if any.
3. AD # (*armor, if applicable*): Armored Defense stat, followed by any modifying armor pieces
4. MD # (*wards, if applicable*): Warded defense stat followed by any modifying wards. 
5. STR # DEX # INT # WIL #: The four ability in a row. Only lists the bonus. Add 10 to get the defense. When a stat line omits the ability, assume that its bonus is 0. 
6. MV # (#): Movement, in feet. The first number is exploration (10 minutes in a dungeon), second number combat movement (10 seconds). Usually omitted if it is 120 (40).
7. Att: Attacks, usually followed by a to-hit bonus, a die (damage), and a parenthetical indicating the weapon, or spell. 
8. Items: List of all items that the creature carries. 
9. *Special ability*: Any additional abilities. [Knacks](Knacks) can appear here. Monsters have their abilities here as well. 

**Example:** 

Ogden Dankworth. L2. HP 13(7). AD 13 (shield, helmet). MD 11. STR 2 DEX 1 INT 1. Att 1 x 1d6 (short sword). Items: crowbar, rope, short sword 1d6, shield ad+1, helmet ad+1, fireball (spellbook), ward md+1. Butcher: When you kill an enemy, you may immediately make another attack
