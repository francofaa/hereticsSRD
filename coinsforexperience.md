# Coins for Experience

Loot can be converted to experience by spending their coin value on special interests.

Only coins gained while adventuring or heist'd from someone count toward experience. Found coins or coins earned through honest work do not count. 

## Special Interests
Player characters must spend their loot by wasting it on special interests. Refer to an example set of special interests below.

1. Carousing
2. Song, Fame, Statues, Paintings. Sponsoring bards and other artists to commemorate you.
3. Religion or Spirituality. Too much donated may cause the gods to pay too much attention to you and not always the god you're looking to appease.
4. Philanthropy
5. Events: races, gladiator shows, duels, masques, festivals, parades, triumphs, jousts, spectacles: you would be sponsoring these things
6. Land / Businesses
7. Training 
8. Hobbies: Animal husbandry, robotics, device creation, languages, brewing, hunting, art, spell research, item creation (smithing, for example).

### Optional Rule: Weak and Strong Special Interests

Characters can be rewarded / punished for spending their special interests in certain ways. At the beginning of the game, they can roll or choose their strong interest and weak interest, and apply a bonus and penalty to each, respectively.

For example:
- Strong: Philanthropy (120%)
- Weak: Land / Businesses (80%)


## Economic Limits

Each population has a limit as to how much can be spent there.

| Community  | Population | GP Limit (1d6 x #) |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Thorpe     | 20         | 10                 |
| Hamlet     | 200        | 50                 |
| Village    | 1,000      | 100                |
| Town       | 5,000      | 500                |
| City       | 25,000     | 1,000              |
| Metropolis | > 25,000   | 10,000                   |

The settlements only have so much stuff to give. Any more money spent in these settlements will cause economic ramifications that are better left not explored.

## Other XP Sources
Experience may also be rewarded for clever solutions and overcoming significant challenges. Winning over important allies or finding clues to a mystery could work.

Experience is not recommended as a reward for "good role-playing" since this may put some players at a disadvantage if they are not comfortable speaking in-character.
