# Combat Round

Resolving a combat is done in **rounds**. Each round represents about 10 seconds.

When a party is in combat, follow the combat round procedure: 

1. Determine [Initiative](#Initiative)
2. Resolve [Actions](#Actions). Movement is part of the action phase.
	- [Melee and Ranged Attacks](#Melee%20and%20Ranged%20Attacks)
	- [Spell casting](#Spell%20casting)
	- [Stunts](#Stunts)
	- [Miscellaneous Actions](#Miscellaneous%20Actions)
3. *If goons or enemies hit a breaking point:* [Morale checks](#Morale%20checks)
4. *If either side decides to retreat:* [Retreat](#Retreat)
5. *If the retreating side is pursued:* [Pursuit](#Pursuit)


## Initiative

Roll 1d6. On a 1-3, the opposing side acts first. On a 4-6, the player characters act first. 

If surprise is possible, on a 1, the player characters are surprised. On a 6, the opposing side is surprised. While a side is surprised, no one on that side may perform any actions. 

Creatures on each side go at the same time, deciding and declaring their actions together.

Initiative is re-rolled every round. 

## Actions

The winning side of initiative acts first, followed by the losing side. Movement is part of these actions and is limited to the maximum movement a creature can make. During a round, a character may make 1 action and 1 free action, if available.

Reactions may also occur during the opposing turn when relevant. Movement away from an enemy does not provoke attacks unless the enemy has a skill that says it does. Movement away from an enemy may not be possible if a creature has hindered that movement in some way.

> A player can be designated as the caller to coordinate the actions of the party. Actions are declared to the referee in whatever order the party agreed on.

### Melee and Ranged Attacks

Narratively, attack rolls represent a series of attacks, feints, near-hits, wounds, parries, and so on.

Melee attacks may be made within 5-10 feet. Ranged attacks cannot be made within melee range. Make a melee or ranged attack by rolling 1d20 and adding the relevant bonus (usually str, but sometimes int or dex if doing a subtle or stealthy attack).

If this value is equal to or over the defender's armored defense score, the attack hits. The attacker then rolls the weapon's damage die, inflicting damage on the defender. 

#### Sundering Attack

Before rolling damage for a melee attack, a character may choose to destroy their weapon in order to inflict double the dice in damage. 

#### Improvised Damage

Unarmed strikes inflict damage equal to the attacker's strength bonus (minimum 0).

Physical damage from small things can be measured in d4 (caltrops, spikes, ball bearings--trip damage).

Physical damage from big things can be measured in d6 (carts, bookshelves, folding chairs).

Elemental damage can be measured in d6 (acid, fire, frost).

### Spell casting

An attacker may choose to cast a spell or a use a [medicinal](Medicinals). Follow the [spellcasting](spellcasting) procedures for more.

### Stunts

Stunts or combat maneuvers are typically a +dex test against a target's relevant defense stat or against a DC set by the referee for an outcome adjudicated by the referee. 

On a failure, the attempt does not succeed, but if there are any potential risks on a failure, the referee should describe them before allowing the roll. 

A stunt can include

   - Extinguishing fire
   - Removing acid
   - Doing a backflip
   - Trip
   - Disarm
   - Taking something out of [deep inventory](Inventory#Quick%20Slots%20and%20Deep%20Slots) during combat
   - Dodging around an enemy
   - Escaping from binds
   - Sliding under and past a gargantuan monster

#### Taking something out of inventory

When an attacker takes something out of their inventory, they must roll +dex versus the DC equal to the item's position in their inventory. On a success, they do it as a free action and can take another action. On a failure, they retrieve the item anyway. 

### Miscellaneous Actions

Actions may include

- reloading a crossbow 
- making another movement
- giving a specific order to retainers (retainers will otherwise follow procedure that their commander has laid out and work to protect their own lives)
- force [morale checks](#Morale%20checks) 

Actions can also be interactions with the environment. If the referee deems this interaction to be minor, they may judge it as a free action and allow the player to make another action. 


### Critical Hits

A 20 is always a success and a 1 is always a failure.

On a natural 20, an attack inflicts double the damage dice. On a natural 1, the attack may provide an opening to the defender, granting an advantageous position to the defender, unless it is mitigated by something else.

On a natural 20, a stunt may provide some additional advantage to the attacker that the referee may deem appropriate. 


### Advantage

Attackers gain advantage from advantageous situations, such as ambushes. 

When an attacker has advantage, they may choose to perform a stunt and an attack at the same time. 

### Disadvantage 

Attackers suffer disadvantage from disadvantageous situations, such as being caught unawares or aiming at a defender that is behind partial cover. 

## Morale checks

A player may request a morale check after certain breaking points: 

- A leader is killed 
- Half of their allies are killed 
- Half of their HP is reduced (if alone)
- Ambushed
- Attacked by something they fear

The requesting character must make a +wil check against the enemy leader's (or strongest remaining enemy's) willpower defense. On a success, the enemies surrender or rout; on a failure, the characters must wait for another breaking point to try again or a character must use an action to force a morale check.

## Retreat

Player characters may break and flee, which causes concentration to drop for any spells and for retainers to make morale checks.

Retainers and allies must make a +wil save using the commander character's +wil bonus against the strongest enemy's wil defense or rout and flee. When their commander has already left battle, they make this save at disadvantage. 

Creatures may choose to pursue the player characters if they are still within line of sight. 

## Pursuit

When fleeing a battle as a group (including retainers and hirelings), the players must describe how they flee the combat and the referee must provide the consequences of failure and success. Each player character must make a relevant saving throw depending on the scenario versus a DC equal to the pursuer's defense score of that skill, plus or minus any modifiers. Players should feel encouraged to drop traps and distractions to escape pursuers.

If all player characters fail their checks, the combat restarts, the enemies acting first with a surprise round.
