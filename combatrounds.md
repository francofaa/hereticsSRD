# Rounds 

Combat rounds last 10 seconds. Refer to [measuring time](measuringtime) for more.

Rounds consist of 

- movements 
- actions
- free actions

Reactions may also occur during the opposing turn when relevant. Movement away from an enemy does not provoke attacks of opportunity unless the enemy has a skill that says it does. 

Movement is 40 feet, typically. A single action may be performed which could be

- a melee or ranged attack
- reloading a crossbow 
- casting a spell (Refer to [spellcasting](spellcasting))
- doing a stunt
- taking something out of your inventory
   - roll +dex versus the DC equal to the item's position in your inventory. On a success, you do the action for free and can take another action. On a failure, you retrieve the item anyway. 
- moving again
- intimidate (when the opposing side has half or fewer enemies left)
- give a specific order to retainers

Or anything else the referee may deem acceptable. 

Narratively, attack rolls represent a series of attacks, feints, near-hits, wounds, parries, and so on.

## Attacking
Melee attacks may be made within 5-10 feet. Ranged attacks cannot be made within melee range. Make a melee or ranged attack by rolling 1d20 and adding the relevant bonus (usually str, but sometimes int or dex if doing a subtle or stealthy attack).

If this value is equal to or over the enemy's armored defense score, the attack hits. The attacker then rolls the weapon's damage die. 

### Sundering Attack 
Before rolling damage for a melee attack, a character may choose to destroy their weapon in order to inflict double the dice in damage. 

### Improvised Damage
Unarmed strikes inflict damage equal to the strength bonus (minimum 0).

Physical damage from small things can be measured in d4 (caltrops, spikes, ball bearings--trip damage)

Physical damage from big things can be measured in d6 (carts, bookshelves, folding chairs)

Elemental damage can be measured in d6 (acid, fire, frost)

**Optional rule: Roll to defend.** If it is preferred to have all of the rolls player-facing, then when an enemy creature makes a melee or ranged attack, roll 1d20 + armored defense bonus against the defense of the ability the enemy is using. If they succeed, the attack misses. If they fail, the attack hits. 

## Morale checks
A player may request a morale check after certain breaking points: 

- A leader is killed 
- Half of their allies are killed 
- Half of their HP is reduced (if alone)
- Ambushed
- Attacked by something they fear

The requesting character must make a +wil check against the enemy leader's (or strongest remaining enemy's) willpower defense. On a success, the enemies surrender or rout; on a failure, the characters must wait for another breaking point to try again. 

## Retreating

Characters may break and flee, which causes concentration to drop for any spells and for retainers to make morale checks. 

Retainers and allies must make a +wil save using the commander character's +wil bonus against the strongest enemy's wil defense or rout and flee. When their commander has already left battle, they make this save at disadvantage. 

Creatures may choose to pursue the characters if they are still within line of sight. Refer to the optional [Pursuit](Pursuit) rules for more.

## Critical Hits

On a natural 20, an attack inflicts twice the dice in damage. On a natural 1, the attack may provide an opening to the opposing side, granting an advantageous position to the opposing side, unless it is mitigated by something else. 

## Advantage

Creatures gain advantage from advantageous situations, such as ambushes. 

When a creature has advantage, they may choose to perform a stunt and an attack at the same time. 

## Disadvantage 

Creatures suffer disadvantage from disadvantageous situations, such as being caught unawares or aiming at a creature that is behind partial cover.
