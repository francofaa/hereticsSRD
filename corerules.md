# Core Rules

This is the core framework of the game rules. 
It only includes rules on character creation, abilities, and mundane items, and should technically only require an adventure or dungeon or scenario to run. 
Everything else could theoretically be adjudicated by the referee or supplemented by other modular rules.

In addition to these core rules, Heretics has modular rules that could be used as well. 
These include things that players and referees may not think of as modular and take for granted in a game as core rules like magic, exploration, advancement, and even combat.

Since the game has not yet entered play-testing, I thought it would make sense to separate these rules out and not entangle them too deeply.
