# d100 spells 

When creating a heretic with a starting spell, refer to [Spell Origins](#spell-origins) to learn where the spell was found.

- Dice: How many magic {dice} were rolled
- Sum: The {sum} of the magic {dice} rolled
- Range is calculated as distance from the caster (the origin)
	- self = no range, spell emits from origin
	- touch = the caster must touch the target
	- close = the caster must be within the same zone
	- nearby = the caster can be up to 1 zone away
	- far = the caster can be up to 2 zones away
- Save: Always vs caster's int def. 
	- Negates means a successful save negates the effects. Half means a successful save reduces damage from the spell by half. Targets can always choose to save
- Attack: Always uses caster's +int bonus and always attacks target's WDEF
- Duration: 0 means the effect is instantaneous. Concentration means the caster can do nothing but concentrate on the spell

Some spells below have their own mishaps and dooms. These are listed with the spell along with the required results.
