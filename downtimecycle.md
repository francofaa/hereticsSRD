# Downtime Cycle

Resolving downtime is done in **cycles**. Cycles can represent anywhere from a week to a month.

When the party is doing downtime, follow the downtime cycle procedure: 

1. Determine [Settlement Resources](#Settlement%20Resources)
2. Characters [Rest and Upkeep](#Rest%20and%20Upkeep)
3. [Downtime Hazard Die](#Downtime%20Hazard%20Die) determines what major events happen during the cycle
4. Characters perform [Free Actions](#Free%20Actions)
	1. [Recruiting](#Recruiting)
	2. [Conspicuous Consumption](#Conspicuous%20Consumption)
	3. [Rumors](#Rumors)
5. Characters perform [Actions](#Actions)
6. Resolve [Faction Activities](#Faction%20Activities)


When socializing with people in the world during downtime, disposition can be determined with a 2d6 roll, unless it is already obvious for whatever reason: 

| 2d6   | Disposition  |
| ----- | ------------ |
| 2-3   | Hostile      |
| 4-5   | Unfriendly   |
| 6-8   | Uninterested |
| 9-10  | Polite       |
| 11-12 | Friendly     |


## Settlement Resources

The size of a settlement determines the amount of available hirelings, retainers, and how much conspicuous consumption spending per week a settlement can handle from a party. The settlements only have so much to sell. Any more money spent in these settlements will cause economic ramifications that are better left not explored.

To use the table, identify the type of settlement the party is at and roll the die in the die modifier column to determine the values of the remaining columns.

| Size       | Die Modifier | Hirelings                    | Retainers    | Coin Spending Ceiling | Population |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- | ---------- |
| Thorpe     | d2           | helpers                      | x 0          | x 50                    | 20         |
| Hamlet     | d4           | helpers, experts             | x 1 (1 HD)   | x 100                 | 200        |
| Village    | d6           | helpers, experts             | x 1 (1d4 HD) | x 100                 | 1,000      |
| Town       | d8           | helpers, experts, x 10 mercs | x 2 (1d4 HD) | x 300                 | 5,000      |
| City       | d10          | helpers, experts, x 10 mercs | x 2 (1d4 HD) | x 500                 | 25,000     |
| Metropolis | d12          | helpers, experts, x 10 mercs | x 2 (1d6 HD) | x 5,000               | >25,000    |

For example, a town has 1d8 helpers, 1d8 experts, 1d8 x 10 mercenaries, 2d8 hireable retainers (of 1d4 HD each), and a coin spending ceiling of 1d8 x 300.

## Rest and Upkeep

At the beginning of the downtime cycle, all characters should 

- Take a long rest (bringing them to full hit protection)
- Spend coin on upkeep

The long rest should not fully restore lingering injuries, except in cases where enough time has passed to restore them. 


| Lifestyle   | Coins per Week | Tags During Downtime Cycle          |
| ----------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Meager      | 7              | Dirty, hungry, threadbare clothing  |
| Comfortable | L x 7          | Clean, fed, respectable clothing    |
| Luxurious   | L x 20         | Pampered, fed, fashionable clothing |


Upkeep includes room and board, but also things like keeping your armor and weaponry clean, mending your socks, and feeding your horses. Lifestyle tags may impact certain interactions in the fiction of the downtime cycle.


## Downtime Hazard Die

Every cycle spent in a settlement, roll 1d6

| d6  | Event                                                                                                                                  |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Encounter. The party encounters a random NPC who comes calling on them. Referee may have a table prepared for this.                    |
| 2   | [Upheaval](#Upheavals). A dramatic upheaval impacts the settlement, inflicting a condition.                                            |
| 3   | Signs. A [local shift](#Local%20Shifts) is foreshadowed (roll on local shift table) or a [rumors](#Rumors) is heard (roll for a rumor) |
| 4   | [Local shift](#Local%20Shifts). Something in the atmosphere of the settlement changes.                                                 |
| 5   | Alleviation. One or more [conditions](#Conditions) end.                                                                                |
| 6   | Free. Nothing happens                                                                                                                  |

### Upheavals

#### Conditions

- Insecurity: People around town are antsy, untrusting, and suspicious. 
- Food shortage: Food and water are hard to come by.
- Disease: People around town are quarantined and dying.
- Famine: Widespread food shortages.
- Drought: Widespread water shortages.
- Destruction: Infrastructure is damaged and requires repairs.

Conditions are ongoing until the characters intervene (which may be impossible in certain situations) or until a downtime cycle where an alleviation is rolled.

For the characters, these conditions will have impact on the fiction and the prices of buying things in town.

### Local Shifts

| d6  | Local Shift                                     |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Factions become allies                           |
| 2   | Religious or cultural event                      |
| 3   | Rivals appear or reappear                        |
| 4   | New faction emerges or old faction disappears    |
| 5   | Scandal                                          |
| 6   | News of a previously unknown place or technology |



## Free Actions

Each character may take free actions, limited mostly to 

- recruiting goons (hirelings and retainers), 
- shopping, 
- throwing and attending funerals, 
- throwing and attending parties,
- looking for rumors,
- conspicuous consumption, 
- and making social calls. 
 
Anything more involved requires a full action. For example, tracking down a specialty item or making a social call on a powerful figure would be an action whereas shopping for ball bearings or having tea with your best friend would be free actions.

### Recruiting

Player characters may hire any number of goons they can afford. [[Goons]] can be paid by the day (hirelings) or for a share of treasure (retainers). Retainers are limited to the employer's +wil bonus.


### Rumors

The party hears a random rumor. The referee should have prepared a rumors table ahead of time. Otherwise, nothing happens.

Creating a rumor table should be based on the nearby regional locations and factions. Each rumor should be actionable. 

Rumors can take on various forms: 

- Local color: General information or history 
- Opportunities: These can take the form of bounties and rewards that can be monetary, favors, or otherwise
- Challenges: Threats that could lead to rewards
- Mysteries: Secrets or strange phenomenon 

### Conspicuous Consumption

During the downtime cycle, characters may convert their coins to experience points. They may only convert coins gained while adventuring or committing crimes. Coins found or earned through honest work cannot be used for this purpose. 

Player characters must spend their loot by wasting it on special interests. Refer to an example set of special interests below.

1. **Carousing**, partying, gambling.
2. **Commissioning** songs, statues, paintings.
3. **Donating** to philanthropic causes, the poor, the hungry.
4. **Sponsoring** races, duels, masques, festivals, parades, triumphs, jousts, spectacles.

## Actions

Each character may take 1 action, which may lead to a specific goal. Possible actions are described below but these are by no means exhaustive.

If a character is [convalescing](Damage.md#Convalescing), they may not be able to take any action and must spend the downtime cycle resting.

Actions may consist of but are not limited to

- [Robberies and heists](robberiesandheists.md)
- [Research and crafting](researchandcrafting.md)
- [Training](training.md)


## Faction Activities

The referee will roll 1d6 for each faction in play in the settlement. On a 4-5, mark 1 progress toward the [faction's](Factions) active goal. On a 6, mark 2 progress. 

Add any bonuses or penalties depending on 
- relevant resources
- rivals to that goal

Once a goal is achieved, the faction may add a resource relevant to the completion of the goal. If the goal impacts another faction, that faction should have a resource removed or changed, or a progress toward a relevant goal reduced. 

### Player Interference

Factions may recruit or butt heads with the player characters. If the characters hinder or help the faction, remove or mark 1-3 progress tallies depending on the help or hindrance. Player characters may even manage to destroy a faction's resource. 

If the characters would take action to interfere with a faction's actions, the downtime cycle should be considered over and play within the city should commence.
