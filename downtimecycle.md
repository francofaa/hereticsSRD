# Downtime Cycle

Resolving downtime is done in **cycles**. Cycles can represent anywhere from a week to a month.

When the party is doing downtime, follow the downtime cycle procedure: 

1. Determine [Settlement Resources](#Settlement%20Resources)
2. Resolve [Bookkeeping](#Bookkeeping) (rest and upkeep).
3. Determine [Rumors](#Rumors)
4. [Downtime Hazard Die](#Downtime%20Hazard%20Die) 
5. Resolve [Free Actions](#Free%20Actions)
6. Resolve [Actions](#Actions)
	- [Magical Research](#Magical%20Research)
	- [Robberies and Heists](#Robberies%20and%20Heists)
	- [Brewing and Crafting](#Brewing%20and%20Crafting)
	- [Learning a Trade](#Learning%20a%20Trade)
	- [Training Knacks](#Training%20Knacks)
	- [Animal Training](#Animal%20Training)
7. Resolve [Conspicuous Consumption](#Conspicuous%20Consumption) to convert coin to experience points
8. Resolve [Faction Activities](#Faction%20Activities). Party and referee decide whether another downtime cycle is needed. 

## Settlement Resources

The size of a settlement determines the amount of available hirelings, retainers, and how much conspicuous consumption spending per week a settlement can handle from a party. The settlements only have so much to sell. Any more money spent in these settlements will cause economic ramifications that are better left not explored.

To use the table, identify the type of settlement the party is at and roll the die in the die modifier column to determine the values of the remaining columns.

| Size       | Die Modifier | Hirelings                    | Retainers    | Coin Spending Ceiling | Population |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- | ---------- |
| Thorpe     | d2           | helpers                      | x 0          | x 50                    | 20         |
| Hamlet     | d4           | helpers, experts             | x 1 (1 HD)   | x 100                 | 200        |
| Village    | d6           | helpers, experts             | x 1 (1d4 HD) | x 100                 | 1,000      |
| Town       | d8           | helpers, experts, x 10 mercs | x 2 (1d4 HD) | x 300                 | 5,000      |
| City       | d10          | helpers, experts, x 10 mercs | x 2 (1d4 HD) | x 500                 | 25,000     |
| Metropolis | d12          | helpers, experts, x 10 mercs | x 2 (1d6 HD) | x 5,000               | >25,000    |

For example, a town has 1d8 helpers, 1d8 experts, 1d8 x 10 mercenaries, 2d8 hireable retainers (of 1d4 HD each), and a coin spending ceiling of 1d8 x 300.

## Bookkeeping

At the beginning of the downtime cycle, all characters should 

- Take a long rest (bringing them to full hit protection)
- Spend coin on upkeep

The long rest should not fully restore lingering injuries, except in cases where enough time has passed to restore them. 


| Lifestyle   | Coins per Week | Tags During Downtime Cycle          |
| ----------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Meager      | 7              | Dirty, hungry, threadbare clothing  |
| Comfortable | L x 7          | Clean, fed, respectable clothing    |
| Luxurious   | L x 20         | Pampered, fed, fashionable clothing |


Upkeep includes room and board, but also things like keeping your armor and weaponry clean, mending your socks, and feeding your horses. Lifestyle tags may impact certain interactions in the fiction of the downtime cycle.

## Rumors

The party hears a random rumor. The referee should have prepared a rumors table ahead of time. Otherwise, nothing happens.

## Downtime Hazard Die

Every cycle spent in a settlement, roll 1d6

| d6  | Event                                                                                                               |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Encounter. The party encounters a random NPC who comes calling on them. Referee may have a table prepared for this. |
| 2   | Upheaval. A dramatic upheaval impacts the settlement, inflicting a condition.                                       |
| 3   | Signs. A local shift is foreshadowed (roll on local shift table) or a rumor is heard (roll for a rumor)     |
| 4   | Local effect. Something in the atmosphere of the settlement changes.                                                 |
| 5   | Alleviation. One or more conditions end.                                                                                                                                |
| 6   | Free. Nothing happens                                                                                               |

### Upheavals

| d6  | Upheaval                                                                                                         | Possible Conditions                     |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Killings (assassinations, serial murders, faction violence)                                                        | Insecurity                              |
| 2   | Siege, Insurrection                                                                                                | Insecurity, Destruction, Food shortage  |
| 3   | Pestilence, Plague, Famine, Drought                                                                                | Disease, Food shortage, Drought, Famine |
| 4   | Tornado, Dust Storm, Cyclone, Blizzard, Earthquake, Volcanic Eruption, Flood, Tsunami, Landslide, Meteor, Sinkhole | Famine, Destruction, Disease            |
| 5   | Ally dies                                                                                                          |                                         |
| 6   | Direct setback to party                                                                                            |                                         |

#### Conditions

- Insecurity: People around town are antsy, untrusting, and suspicious. 
- Food shortage: Food and water are hard to come by.
- Disease: People around town are quarantined and dying.
- Famine: Widespread food shortages.
- Drought: Widespread water shortages.
- Destruction: Infrastructure is damaged and requires repairs.

Conditions are ongoing until the characters intervene (which may be impossible in certain situations) or until a downtime cycle where an alleviation is rolled.

For the characters, these conditions will have impact on the fiction and the prices of buying things in town.

### Local Effects

| d6   | Local Change                                     |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Factions become allies                           |
| 2   | Religious or cultural event                      |
| 3   | Rivals appear or reappear                        |
| 4   | New faction emerges or old faction disappears    |
| 5   | Scandal                                          |
| 6   | News of a previously unknown place or technology |



## Free Actions

Each character may take free actions, limited mostly to 

- recruiting goons (hirelings and retainers), 
- shopping, 
- throwing and attending funerals, 
- throwing and attending parties,
- and making social calls. 
 
Anything more involved requires a full action. For example, tracking down a specialty item or making a social call on a powerful figure would be an action whereas shopping for ball bearings or having tea with your best friend would be free actions.

### Recruiting

Player characters may hire any number of goons they can afford. [[Goons]] can be paid by the day (hirelings) or for a share of treasure (retainers). Retainers are limited to the employer's +wil bonus.





## Actions

Each character may take 1 action, which may lead to a specific goal. Possible actions are described below but these are by no means exhaustive.

When socializing with people in the world during downtime, disposition can be determined with a 2d6 roll, unless it is already obvious for whatever reason: 

| 2d6   | Disposition  |
| ----- | ------------ |
| 2-3   | Hostile      |
| 4-5   | Unfriendly   |
| 6-8   | Uninterested |
| 9-10  | Polite       |
| 11-12 | Friendly     |


### Magical Research

Inventing spells is dangerous. When working to invent a spell, spend 1,000 coins in research activities and resources, spend a week in time, acquire an object to house the spell, and roll +int against a DC 20. On a success, you create the spell with the referee and must cast it once using all of your mana dice. On a fail, roll all of your mana dice and make a +warded defense save against your int defense. On a success, any dooms and mishaps are negated. On a failure, they are not. 


### Robberies and Heists

The characters may wish to commit a robbery or perform a heist to fund themselves. This procedure may be used if this heist or robbery is not intended to be part of the gameplay. Otherwise, the downtime cycle should be resolved and normal gameplay time commence with the planning of the heist or robbery. 

Every character that contributes in the scheme adds +1 to the +int roll by the mastermind of the scheme. Any character that contributes to the scheme should describe how and may not perform any other action: They are considered to be taking part in the scheme. 

The mastermind should declare whether violence will be used. If violence is used, they receive a +1 to their roll.

The mastermind should declare whether illicit substances or materials will be used and which ones. If illicit substances or materials are used, they receive a +1 to their roll.

| Rank | Type        | Description                           | Coin          | DC  |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------- | --- |
| 1    | Individuals | A lone person or group                | 1d20          | 10  |
| 2    | Home        | An undefended home                    | L x d20       | 15  |
| 3    | Storefront  | A moderately-defended establishment   | L x d20 x 10  | 18  |
| 4    | Vault       | A well-defended establishment or home | L x d20 x 100 | 20  |

When violence and/or illicit materials or substances are used, the roll is considered to be modified. 

| Modified? | Rank 1    | Rank 2    | Rank 3    | Rank 4    | Punishment                                                                                           |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Yes       | Natural 1 | Natural 1 | Natural 1 | Natural 1 | Arrest, sentenced to death                                                                           |
| Yes       | 1-9       | 1-9       | 1-9       | 1-9       | Arrest, sentenced Rank x 10 downtime cycles                                                          |
| No        | 1-5       | 1-9       | 1-9       | 1-9       | Arrest, sentenced Rank x 1d10 downtime cycles                                                        |
| No        | 6-9       | 10-14     | 10-17     | 10-19     | Escape (mastermind chooses 1), taking nothing or taking half the loot and leaving evidence/witnesses |
| Yes       | 10-12     | 15-17     | 18-20     | 20-22     | Escape with loot (mastermind chooses 1), leaving witnesses or victims (1/4 chance they are dead)     |
| No        | 10-12     | 15-17     | 18-20     | 20-22     | Escape with loot (mastermind chooses 1), leaving half or leaving witnesses/evidence                  |
| Either    | 13+       | 18+       | 21+       | 23+       | Escape with loot                                                                                     |

When there is an active investigation, the participants in a robbery or heist must lay low (meaning they may not perform free actions, actions, or conspicuous consumption) for a number of downtime cycles determined by the following table: 

| Number of Downtime Cycles | Result            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 1                         | Successful Escape |
| 1d4 x rank                | Left witnesses    |
| 1d8 x rank                | Left evidence     |
| 1d12 x rank               | Left a corpse     |


### Brewing and Crafting

Inventing potions is dangerous. When working to invent a potion, spend 1,000 coins in research activities and resources, spend a week in time, and roll +int against a DC 20. On a success, you gain potions 5/5. On a failure, your brewing goes wrong and you suffer a mishap, adjudicated by the referee. 

### Learning a Trade

Learning a certain trade from an instructor costs time, training, and coin. 

Choose a [background](charactercreation.md#4.%20Background%20Starting%20Gear) trade or make up a background with the referee. The player and referee should agree to what abilities the character will receive upon the various stages of training.

The character rolls 1d20 + a relevant ability and compares the result to the table below. The character may attempt 1 training session per downtime cycle.

| 1d20  | Result                                           |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 16-20 | Training is successful: Advance to next level.   |
| 10-15 | Next downtime cycle, the training is successful. |
| 0-9   | No progress is made during training.                                                 |

To reach each level of expertise, an appropriate instructor must be found and hired, the training session paid for, and the appropriate number of *successful* training sessions to be completed. 

To reach the level of a legend in the trade, the referee may require specific quests to be completed. 

| Level        | Coin per Training Attempt | Successful Training Sessions |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Novice       | 1,000                     | 1                            |
| Professional | 2,000                     | 2                            |
| Master       | 4,000                     | 3                            |
| Legend       | n/a                       | n/a                          |

### Training Knacks

Rather than acquiring [Knacks](Knacks) through the expenditure of ability points upon leveling, a character can train a knack. 

Learning a knack from an instructor costs time, training, and coin. 

The character rolls 1d20 + a relevant ability and compares the result to the table below. The character may attempt 1 training session per downtime cycle.

| 1d20  | Result                                           |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 16-20 | Training is successful.                          |
| 10-15 | Next downtime cycle, the training is successful. |
| 0-9   | No progress is made during training.             |

A character must succeed three times to acquire the knack, spending 1,000 coins per attempt. If the character fails three times in total, they are refused further training. Another instructor must be found and the process must start all over. 

### Animal Training

Training animals requires time, successful trainings, and coin. 

The character rolls 1d20 + wil and compares the result to the table below. The character may attempt 1 training session per downtime cycle.

| 1d20  | Result                                           |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 16-20 | Training is successful.                          |
| 10-15 | Next downtime cycle, the training is successful. |
| 0-9   | No progress is made during training.             |


All but domesticated animals must be tamed before being trained to obey a special command. Once tamed, an animal will obey commands per their stat line and they may be treated as retainers (without counting toward the retainer number).

If the character fails three times in a row to tame or train an animal, that animal cannot be tamed or trained to follow that special command. 

| Category               | Sessions to Tame | Sessions to Train | Coin Cost per Session |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Domesticated           | 0                | 1                 |   100                    |
| Feral                  | 1                | 1                 |      200                 |
| Wild                   | 2                | 2                 |     400                  |
| Monstrous/Supernatural | 3                | 3                 |        1,000               |


## Convalescing

The injuries feeble, shaky, addled, and weak (referenced in [convalescing](Damage)) may be removed after a number of downtime cycles equal to the lowest result from rolling a number of d6 equal to character level (*Ld6, take the lowest*).

For example, a level 4 character rolls 4d6, resulting in a 3, 3, 5, and 6. The lowest number is 3, so the character's ability is restored after 3 downtime cycles.

## Conspicuous Consumption

During the downtime cycle, characters may convert their coins to experience points. They may only convert coins gained while adventuring or committing crimes. Coins found or earned through honest work cannot be used for this purpose. 

Player characters must spend their loot by wasting it on special interests. Refer to an example set of special interests below.

1. **Carousing**, partying, gambling.
2. **Commissioning** songs, statues, paintings.
3. **Donating** to philanthropic causes, the poor, the hungry.
4. **Sponsoring** races, duels, masques, festivals, parades, triumphs, jousts, spectacles.

Optionally, characters can be rewarded / punished for spending their coins on certain special interests. At the beginning of the game, they can roll or choose their strong interest and weak interest, and apply a bonus and penalty to each, respectively.

For example:
- Strong: Donating (120%)
- Weak: Sponsoring (80%)

## Faction Activities

The refree will roll 1d6 for each faction in play in the settlement. On a 4-5, mark 1 progress toward the [faction](Factions)'s active goal. On a 6, mark 2 progress. 

Add any bonuses or penalties depending on 
- relevant resources
- rivals to that goal

Once a goal is achieved, the faction may add a resource relevant to the completion of the goal. If the goal impacts another faction, that faction should have a resource removed or changed, or a progress toward a relevant goal reduced. 

### Player Interference

Factions may recruit or butt heads with the player characters. If the characters hinder or help the faction, remove or mark 1-3 progress tallies depending on the help or hindrance. Player characters may even manage to destroy a faction's resource. 

If the characters would take action to interfere with a faction's actions, the downtime cycle should be considered over and play within the city should commence.
