# Dueling Beats

Resolving a duel is done in **beats**. Beats can represent any amount of time that is sensible to the scenario.

When two parties are in a duel, follow the dueling beat procedure: 

1. Secretly choose and reveal a [Strategy](#Strategy)
	- [Parry](#Parry)
	- [Push](#Push)
	- [Feint](#Feint)
2. Resolve [Action](#Action). Determine whether the duel should continue or not. 

## Strategy

Both parties secretly choose a strategy from the following:

- Parry 
- Push
- Feint

### Parry 

Parry beats push. The parrying character fends off the clumsy attacker and receives +3 to their armored defense.

### Push

Push beats feint. The pushing character batters the attempts at finesse and inflicts +3 damage on a hit.

### Feint

Feint beats parry. The feinting character creates openings in the parrying character's defenses, receiving +3 to hit.

## Action

Both parties roll their attacks using their weapons as normal, applying the bonuses based on their strategies.

If both sides choose the same effect, they receive the same bonuses. Parrying characters have a defensive standoff (+3 to ADef), pushing characters bloody each other recklessly (+3 to damage), feinting characters pirouette and counter each other (+3 to hit).

The end of a duel can happen at any point that makes sense in the gameplay, whether through the interruption of a larger conflict, the surrender of an opponent, or the death of an opponent.
