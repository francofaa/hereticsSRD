# Dungeon Turn

Exploring a dungeon is done in **turns**. Each turn represents about 10 minutes.

When a party is in a dungeon, follow the dungeon turn procedure: 

1. Characters perform [Actions](#Actions). 
	- [Searching](#Searching)
	- [Movement](#Movement)
	- [Resting](#Resting)
	- [Harvesting Monster Parts](#Harvesting%20Monster%20Parts)
	- [Leaving the Dungeon](#Leaving%20the%20Dungeon)
2. [Dungeon Hazard Die](#Dungeon%20Hazard%20Die) determines what happens during the turn

## Actions
The party decides what action to take, like moving, searching, listening, entering a room. 

### Searching

Characters may search for 
- room traps (within a 10 x 10 area)
- secret doors (within a 10 x 10 area)
- treasure traps (on a specific object or location)

#### Light 
Torches illuminate 40 feet and 10 feet of detail.

Candles illuminate 20 feet and 5 feet of detail. 

Lanterns function as candles and can be modified to illuminate a straight line rather than a radius. They cannot be blown out. 

**Darkvision is not perfect:** Monochrome outlines of moving shapes in darkness. Dim light is **moonlight**. Anything for which **fine eyesight** is required will be difficult even with darkvision.

### Movement

Characters move at a rate of 3 times their base speed. So a character that moves 40 feet in a combat turn moves 120 feet (24 five foot squares) in a dungeon turn, which represents **slow careful movement**, allowing for investigation of traps, secret doors, and treasure traps; listening for noises; and mapping the environment.

Characters **walking at a normal pace** may cover 2,400 feet (480 five foot squares) in a dungeon turn without the ability to perform other actions like searching. All encounters will happen with surprise and traps will spring on the characters. 

Characters **running** may cover 4,800 feet (960 five foot squares). In addition to the penalties of walking, characters will also be unable to map their environment and candles will blow out. Running through already explored areas will be easier, but running into unknown areas is dangerous and disorienting. 

### Resting

Resting for 1 hour in the dungeon heals 1d8 + str bonus. Resting for 8 hours is not possible in a dungeon.

### Harvesting Monster Parts

Monster parts may also be used to craft items, in coordination with the referee and may require appropriate checks. Intelligence check against a DC equal to 10 + monster HD may be appropriate for harvesting. Harvesting requires knowledge and care when extracting things like venoms, horns, teeth, digestive acids, and so on. 

### Leaving the Dungeon 

Sometimes there is insufficient time to escape a dungeon to a safe location during a session. When it is necessary that a party be back in a safe place or back at a camp, as may be during an open table campaign, the characters may roll to return to a safe camp. 

> N.B. This is should only be used if the players do not have time or do not wish to play out their escape from the dungeon.

The referee determines whether this is a **dangerous** or **arduous** journey. Players use their best skill to roll, describing how it helps their escape.

DC = 10 + hour of travel + number of rooms from the exit of the dungeon, maximum of DC 20

On a success, the characters return to camp. 

On a failure, the characters pay a cost: 

- Dangerous: 1d6 damage is inflicted for every 1 under the DC
- Arduous: lose 1 item per 1 under the DC

If a character is reduced to 0 flesh, they **die** or are left unconscious, suffering all of the effects of being reduced to 0. The referee picks what is dropped, starting with less valuable and less secure items, and working up to weapons, armor, spells, and magical items.



## Dungeon Hazard Die

Every turn in a dungeon, roll 1d6. 


| d6  | Result                                                                                                                 |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Encounter. A wandering monster appears 2d6 x 10 feet away, moving toward the party. Roll 2d6 to determine disposition. |
| 2   | Fatigue. Rest for 1 turn or make rolls at disadvantage.                                                                |
| 3   | Signs. Characters find a clue or sign of wandering monster or factions.                                                |
| 4   | Local effect. Something unique to the dungeon happens.                                                                 |
| 5   | Depletion. Torches gutter out or lantern oil depletes by half.                                                                                                                       |
| 6   | Free. Nothing happens.                                                                                                       |

During the first 6 turns of a dungeon delve, nothing happens on a 4-6 to maintain verisimilitude (and avoid situations like torches guttering out on the first turn).

### Encounter Vibe Check

If another creature is encountered, determine their disposition, unless it is already predetermined or obvious. Disposition can be determined with a 2d6 roll: 

| 2d6   | Disposition  |
| ----- | ------------ |
| 2-3   | Hostile      |
| 4-5   | Unfriendly   |
| 6-8   | Uninterested |
| 9-10  | Polite       |
| 11-12 | Friendly     |

Encounters may result in [combat](combatround).
