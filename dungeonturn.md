# Dungeon Turn

Exploring a dungeon is done in **turns**. Each turn represents about 10 minutes.

When a party is in a dungeon, follow the dungeon turn procedure: 

1. Characters perform [Actions](#actions). 
	- [Searching](#searching)
	- [Movement](#movement)
	- [Resting](#resting)
	- [Harvesting Monster Parts](#harvesting-monster-parts)
	- [Leaving the Dungeon](#leaving-the-dungeon)
2. [Dungeon Hazard Die](#dungeon-hazard-die) determines what happens during the turn

## Actions
The party decides what action to take, like moving, searching, listening, entering a room. 

### Searching

Characters may search for 
- room traps (within a 10 x 10 area)
- secret doors (within a 10 x 10 area)
- treasure traps (on a specific object or location)

#### Light 

Torches illuminate nearby objects (2 zones) and close details.

Candles illuminate close objects and details. 

Lanterns function as candles and can be modified to illuminate a straight line rather than a radius. They cannot be blown out. 

**Darkvision is not perfect:** Monochrome outlines of moving shapes in darkness. Dim light is **moonlight**. Anything for which **fine eyesight** is required will be difficult even with darkvision.

### Movement

Characters move at a rate of 3 times their base speed (3 zones total). So a character that moves 40 feet in a combat turn moves 120 feet (24 five foot squares) in a dungeon turn. This movement is **slow and careful**, allowing for investigation of traps, secret doors, and treasure traps; listening for noises; and mapping the environment.

Characters may move much faster than this. Technically, a character could cover 20 zones walking at a normal pace or 200 zones while running. Moving through already explored areas is easier but moving through unknown areas will trigger surprises and traps. 

### Resting

Resting for 1 hour in the dungeon only heals 1d8 + str bonus. Resting for 8 hours is not possible in a dungeon.

### Harvesting Monster Parts

Monster parts may also be used to craft items, in coordination with the referee and may require appropriate checks. Intelligence check against a DC equal to 10 + monster HD may be appropriate for harvesting. Harvesting requires knowledge and care when extracting things like venoms, horns, teeth, digestive acids, and so on. 

### Leaving the Dungeon 

Sometimes there is insufficient time to escape a dungeon to a safe location during a session. When it is necessary that a party be back in a safe place or back at a camp, as may be during an open table campaign, the characters may roll to return to a safe camp. 

> N.B. This is should only be used if the players do not have time or do not wish to play out their escape from the dungeon.

The referee determines whether this is a **dangerous** or **arduous** journey. Players use their best skill to roll, describing how it helps their escape.

DC = 10 + length of travel + number of rooms from the exit of the dungeon, maximum of DC 20

On a success, the characters return to camp. 

On a failure, the characters pay a cost: 

- Dangerous: 1d6 damage is inflicted for every 1 under the DC
- Arduous: lose 1 item per 1 under the DC

If a character is reduced to 0 hit protection, they suffer an omen and are forced to make an omen roll. The referee picks what is dropped, starting with less valuable and less secure items, and working up to weapons, armor, spells, and magical items.

## Dungeon Hazard Die

Every turn in a dungeon, roll 1d6. 

| d6  | Result                                                                                                                        |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Encounter. A wandering monster appears at a far distance, moving toward the party. Roll 2d6 to determine disposition.         |
| 2   | Fatigue. Rest for 1 turn or become tired (no effect). If you are already tired, become exhausted, make rolls at disadvantage. |
| 3   | Signs. Characters find a clue or sign of wandering monster or factions.                                                       |
| 4   | Local effect. Something unique to the dungeon happens.                                                                        |
| 5   | Depletion. Light sources dim. Dim light sources go out.                                                                       |
| 6   | Free. Nothing happens.                                                                                                        |

During the first 6 turns of a dungeon delve, nothing happens on a 4-6 to maintain verisimilitude (and avoid situations like torches guttering out on the first turn).

### Encounter Vibe Check

If another creature is encountered, determine their disposition, unless it is already predetermined or obvious. Disposition can be determined with a 2d6 roll: 

| 2d6   | Disposition  |
| ----- | ------------ |
| 2-3   | Hostile      |
| 4-5   | Unfriendly   |
| 6-8   | Uninterested |
| 9-10  | Polite       |
| 11-12 | Friendly     |

Encounters may result in [combat](combatround).
