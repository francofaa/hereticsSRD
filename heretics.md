## Compatibility 

These rules are intended to be compatible with adventures designed for games like those listed below. B/X modules or modules written to be B/X compatible should work as well. If that is not the case, let me know!

## Ludography

*Heretics* is a cobbled-together game in the folk tradition of homebrew gaming tables with various ideas, mechanics, and philosophies borrowed (looted) from treacherous delves into blogs, forums, chat groups, adventures, and systems. A complete catalogue of those would be impossible due to the nature of memory and due to the litigious natures of certain organizations who don't even like to be mentioned. But those I have remembered are listed below:
