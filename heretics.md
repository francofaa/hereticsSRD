## Inspiration and Sources

Many of these games inspired each other, so I am only noting where I first encountered certain concepts:
- [Arcane Ugly](https://miscastterrain.itch.io/arcaneugly) for mishaps and wands (and also a thanks for documenting the process of creating a TTRPG)
- [Knave](https://questingbeast.itch.io/knave) (Heretics is mostly a hack of Knave)
- [Goblin Laws of Gaming](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-glog.html) for mana dice and spells
- [Five Torches Deep](https://www.fivetorchesdeep.com/) for supply, monster math, and charisma for retainers
- [Cairn](cairnrpg.com/) for spells
- [Mausritter](https://mausritter.com/) for inventory and spells as artifacts
- [Stars Without Number](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/230009/stars-without-number-revised-edition-free-version) for one-roll tables
- [Maze Rats](https://questingbeast.itch.io/maze-rats) for name generators
- [Apocalypse World](http://www.apocalypse-world.com/) and [Monster of the Week](https://evilhat.com/product/monster-of-the-week/) for doomsday clocks, tags, and introducing me to playing to find out what happens
- [DURF](https://emielboven.itch.io/durf) for being very similar to what I ended up making but only found toward the end of writing
- [Ironsworn](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/) for retirement rules
- [Old School Essentials](https://necroticgnome.com/) for monster stats, generators, and dungeon exploration rules
- [Morkborg](https://morkborg.com/) for weird aesthetics, dungeons, and horrible artifacts 
- [Ryuutama](https://kotodama.itch.io/ryuutama-natural-fantasy-roleplay) for travel rules
- [The Monsters Know What They're Doing](https://www.themonstersknow.com/) for general monster strategy
- [Principia Apocrypha](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rN5w4-azTq3Kbn0Yvk9nfqQhwQ1R5by1/view) for OSR principles 
- Errants for a lot of modular items found here

This game is intended to be compatible with material written for Old School Revival games.
