## Dice Poker
Roll 4d6, keep them hidden. Pick one out of the 4 that you don't want to use and reveal that dice on the table in front of you. Everyone does this. Betting starts, poker style (1 round) with the person who put out the highest dice - progressing clockwise.

Once bets are settled, reveal the 3 hidden dice. The person with the highest total wins.

## Shooting Dragons
-   Roll 2d6
-   Win if you get 7 or 12
-   If you don't you can double your bet and roll 1d6 and add it to your previous total to try to hit 7 or 12 again

## Fox Dice
_**Kitsune Bakuchi**_ is a [dice game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_game "Dice game") from [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan") in which a player tries to roll three dice with the same number on them. If the player succeeds, he or she wins **36** times the amount wagered. The term literally means "fox gambling."

## Cho-Han (Odd-Even)
The game uses two standard six-sided dice, which are shaken in a bamboo cup or bowl by a dealer. The cup is then overturned onto the floor. Players then place their wagers on whether the sum total of numbers showing on the two dice will be "Ch≈ç" (even) or "Han" (odd). The dealer then removes the cup, displaying the dice. The winners collect their money.

Depending on the situation, the dealer will sometimes act as the house, collecting all losing bets. More often, the players will bet against each other (this requires an equal number of players betting on odd and even) and the house will collect a set percentage of winning bets.
