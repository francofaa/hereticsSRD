a short guide by Franco A. Alvarado

a tool/expansion for creating familiars in games powered by the apocalypse and other 2d6 systems


## Meet your familiar

Your familiar is your constant companion, a spirit inhabiting a creature of your choice, smaller than a large dog. You understand its animal-speak, and it understands you. It inflicts 1 damage hand. It has 4 health. When it suffers the last of its harm, it dissipates and can be summoned again.

Familiars may be used, at the gamemaster's discretion, as an arcane focus or a component for big spells or rituals.

To get to know your familiar, answer some questions:
- How did you meet your familiar?
- What animal form does your familiar take on? 
- What is the significance of that animal form?

## Traits

Familiars have their own personalities, just like us. Select or roll for 1 power, 1 negative trait, and 1 fear. The manner of selecting is up to the gamemaster. It may be that the gamemaster chooses the negative trait and fear while the power is chosen by the summoner.

For all summonings after the first, refer to the move summon under moves.

The following tables provide the conditions under which your familiar is summoned. These include offerings, time of day, lunar phase (if applicable), and location.

The conditions can and should relate in some way to the manner in which your familiar presents. Refer to traits for more about your familiar.

 ## Familiar Moves

Discuss with your gamemaster which moves may be available, or which moves can be added as leveling happens or critical moments in the story.

### Channel

When you try to experience your familiar's senses, roll +bond. Your familiar does not need to be within view to use this. On a hit, you sense everything your familiar does. 10+, choose 2; 7-9, choose 1:

- The effect lasts a long time
- You are able to go on speaking and moving
- You can control the familiar's movements Miss, the familiar controls you.

### Command
When you want your familiar to do something within reason, roll +bond. On a hit, it follows your command

- 10+ exactly
- 7-9, imperfectly and/or its negative tag is triggered

On a miss, something goes awry

### Omens

At the start of a new chapter in the game, roll +bond. Your familiar relays to you in a dream a portent of things to come.

On a hit, if you prevent it from happening, mark experience. On a 10+, you take +1 forward when you act against it.

On a miss, the gamemaster holds 3 to spend as penalties against rolls you make.

### Poison/Venom
When your familiar is touched by another creature that can be poisoned, roll +bond. On a 10+, both; on 7-9, pick one:

- The creature is now unstable
- The creature suffers 1 harm 

### Attack

When you command your familiar to attack an enemy, roll +bond. On a hit, harm is exchanged as normal. On a 10+, choose one extra effect:

-  Your familiar grants your party an advantage: take +1 forward or give +1 forward to another character
- Your familiar inflicts terrible harm (+1 harm)
- Your familiar suffers less harm (-1 harm)
- Your familiar forces the enemy where they want them
- Your familiar injects venom into the enemy (if familiar has +venom)
-  Your familiar does not trigger a negative element tag (if familiar has +elemental)

### Resummon

When you summon your familiar after it dies, satisfy the conditions for summoning and roll +bond. On a 10+, pick one. On a 7-9, pick two:

- Add a new fear to the familiar based on its manner of death
- Bond stat starts at -1 / Take -1 ongoing to familiar rolls
- One familiar move is unavailable

On a miss, the familiar is too weak, fearful, or resentful to return. It may be resummoned at a different time.
   
## Familiar Bond Stat (optional)
The familiar bond stat is used for the familiar moves and fluctuates throughout the gameplay. Alternatively, the summoner may use the magic casting stat in the game to use the moves.

When you indulge your familiar when one of its negative traits is triggered, take +1 bond.

When you heal, soothe, or comfort your familiar at the expense of another action, take +1 bond.

When your bond reaches +4, reset it to +1 and confide one secret to your familiar.

When your familiar suffers harm that was the result of your actions, take -1 bond.

When your familiar suffers from its fear that you do not comfort right away at the expense of another action, take -1 bond.

When your bond reaches -3, reset it to -1.

The gamemaster may also use their discretion to determine when the stat changes.

## Leveling Options
It is up to the gamemaster’s discretion as to when a familiar can gain a new power. Since the powers are often equivalent to moves a player may take, the recommendation is that these are added as alternatives to leveling options. Alternatively, new powers could be added based on story milestones.

## For the gamemaster
Make the familiar real and have its own motivations.

Don't forget that it wants to help the summoner it is paired to. The bond that the summoner has with the familiar may be new or old, but keep in mind any baggage an old relationship may have and any growing pains a new relationship would have in order to make that relationship feel real. The familiar is ostensibly a partner, not a subordinate, in a symbiotic relationship with the summoner, and patterns of abuse may mean no amount of coins or prayers or interpretive dance will convince the familiar to return.

Make the familiar an ally. The familiar is not an extension of the summoner. It is a new ally for the caster, and therefore, acts as an ally mechanically and is controlled by the gamemaster. This means the familiar may be negotiated with, be put in danger, and turn on the summoner.

Make the familiar feel eerie. This is not a pet; it is an otherworldly being tasked with assisting the summoner. It is a strange creature with an unknowable true form and a mysterious origin.

Make the death of the familiar feel significant. Even though the familiar can be summoned, death is physically painful and mentally traumatic, and the familiar may feel resentment or gain a new fear upon its return.
