# Level Zero Start

In order to run a funnel adventure (in which players control multiple characters to see who makes it to level 1), a referee may deem it interesting to start all of the characters at level zero. 

To create a level zero character,

1. Roll 1d8 for your [flesh points](Damage#Damage). You have 0 grit.
2. All abilities start at 0 bonus / 10 defense. 
3. Roll for one background
4. Take 2 days' worth of rations, 2 torches, and 1 [weapon](MartialGear). 
5. Roll all dice to determine [character traits](charactercreation#6.%20Traits)

## Advancing to Level 1

Upon turning in 100 experience points, you reach level 1. Note that level 2 is still 1,000 experience points, so therefore, you only need 900 to get to the next level.

Determine your new level 1 abilities using [Ability Score Generation rules](charactercreation#1.%20Ability%20Score%20Generation) as normal. Based on the funnel adventure, narratively, you may want to increase or decrease certain abilities. 

Roll 1d8 to determine your grit. Add 1 to your flesh points.
