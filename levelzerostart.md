> This is an optional rule for how to create level zero characters and funnel them into first level characters. 

# Level Zero Start

Level 0 characters do not start as heretics, and therefore, **they do not have magic dice or omens and cannot suffer dooms or mishaps**. Without omens, **level 0 characters die at 0 HP**.

Funnel adventures for level 0 characters end with the characters becoming heretics, making a loose agreement with the [Source](Source) in exchange for power.

## Character Creation

To create a level 0 character,

1. Roll 1d8 for your hit protection.
2. All abilities start at 0 bonus / 10 defense. 
	1. Max inventory = 10 (strength defense)
	2. Armored defense = 10 (dexterity defense)
	3. Maximum ammo = 10 (dexterity defense)
	4. Magic Dice = not applicable (willpower bonus, Source needed)
	5. Maximum retainers = 0 (willpower bonus)
	6. Warded defense = 10 (willpower defense)
	7. Maximum supply = 10 (intelligence defense)
	8. Omens = not applicable (Source needed
3. Roll d8 x d6 for a [background](charactercreation#Gear). 
4. Add 2 days' worth of rations and 2 torches to inventory.
5. Roll all dice to determine [Traits](charactercreation#traits).
6. Choose a [Name](charactercreation#name)
7. Determine [Languages](charactercreation#languages)

## Funneling 

Funnel adventures feature players controlling multiple level 0 characters in order to see who makes it to become a level 1 heretic.

## Advancing to Level 1

At the end of the funnel adventure, you reach level 1 and gain the favor of a Source.

1. Add an Omens section to your sheet. You start with 0 omens. 
2. Roll [Ability Scores](charactercreation#ability-scores) and calculate [Secondary Attributes](charactercreation#secondary-attributes) 

Starting equipment and relationship to Source should be based on funnel adventure. 

Determine your new level 1 abilities using the [character creation](charactercreation) rules as normal. Based on the funnel adventure, narratively, you may want to increase or decrease certain abilities. 

Reroll your hit protection at advantage (roll 2d8, take the higher).
