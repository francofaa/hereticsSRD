# Level Zero Start

In order to run a funnel adventure (in which players control multiple characters to see who makes it to level 1), a referee may deem it interesting to start all of the characters at level zero. 

To create a level zero character,

1. Roll 1d8 for your hit protection.
2. All abilities start at 0 bonus / 10 defense. 
3. Roll for one background
4. Take 2 days' worth of rations, 2 torches, and 1 [weapon](MartialGear). 
5. Roll all dice to determine [Traits](charactercreation#Traits)

## Advancing to Level 1

Upon turning in 100 experience points, you reach level 1. Note that level 2 is still 2,000 experience points, so therefore, you only need 1,900 to get to the next level.

Determine your new level 1 abilities using the [character creation](charactercreation) rules as normal. Based on the funnel adventure, narratively, you may want to increase or decrease certain abilities.
