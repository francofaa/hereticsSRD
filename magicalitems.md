# Magical Items

- **Weapons:** Weapons with magical properties. Note that weapons of different materials (silver, gold, obsidian) are not magical unless specified to be magical. 
- **Focuses:** Wands, rods, staffs used to improve spell-casting. You may only wield one of these at a time. 
- **Objects of Power:** Items with magical effects. 
- **Wards:** Wards with protective magical abilities.
- **Spells:** Written, carved, or observed in objects like vials of water, strips of bark, runestones, tablets, books, and so on. The object is required to be carried or the spell diagrams written somewhere. Each spell takes up an inventory slot, even if multiple spells are inscribed into a single object.

## Spells

Spells are cast from written words and diagrams, thereby removing the need for tracking separate spell slots. Spells take up item slots and must be used with two hands when cast, unless wielding a focus in another hand.

## Wards

Wards augment Warded defense. Starting wards are very simple, likely made by the character, local religious figures, wise folks, or stumbled upon. 

### Starting Wards

Characters may not start with stronger wards than wdef+1. When [creating a player character](charactercreation) that has a ward, roll on the table below to determine what form the ward takes and how the heretic came across it.

### Breaking Wards

As an action, a heretic may break a ward to nullify a [mishap](MishapsandDooms). Broken wards cannot be repaired.


## Focuses

Magical focuses, such as orbs, wands, or staves, may grant special powers. Generally, a focus could grant a number of non-renewable magic dice per day (that is, magic dice that do not return to your pool regardless of the result). Focuses can also make casting [Wild Magic](spellcasting#wild-magic) safer. Casting a specific effect using wild magic and a focus may result in that new magical effect inhabiting the focus and becoming a spell. The player and referee may work together to create a new spell. 

### Starting Focuses

When [creating a player character](charactercreation) that has a focus, roll on the table below to determine what form the focus takes and how the heretic came across it. Each of these focuses provides 1 magic die.
