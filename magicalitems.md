# Magical Items

- **Weapons:** Weapons with magical properties. Note that weapons of different materials (silver, gold, obsidian) are not magical unless specified to be magical. 
- **Focuses:** Wands, rods, staffs used to improve spell-casting. You may only wield one of these at a time. 
- **Objects of Power:** Items with magical effects. 
- **Wards:** Wards with protective magical abilities.
- **Spells:** Written or carved into objects like books, monographs, runestones, tablets, and so on. The object is required to be carried or the spell diagrams written somewhere. Each spell takes up an inventory slot, even if multiple spells are inscribed into a single object.

## Spells

Spells are cast from written words and diagrams, thereby removing the need for tracking separate spell slots. Spells take up item slots and must be used with two hands when cast, unless wielding a focus in another hand.

## Wards

Wards augment Warded defense. Starting wards are very simple, likely made by the character, local religious figures, wise folks, or stumbled upon. 

Characters may not start with stronger wards than wdef+1.

Examples: 

- fetish wdef+1, 10 coins
- chain wdef+1, 20 coins
- charm wdef+1, 10 coins
- scapular wdef+1, 5 coins

### Breaking Wards

Wards may be broken to nullify mishaps and dooms. A +1 wdef ward is required to nullify a mishap. To nullify a doom, wards providing a cumulative +wdef of +3 must be destroyed. 

Broken wards cannot be repaired. 


## Focuses

Magical focuses, such as orbs, wands, or staves, may grant special powers. Generally, a focus could grant a number of non-renewable magic dice per day (that is, magic dice that do not return to your pool regardless of the result). Focuses can also make casting [Wild Magic](spellcasting#wild-magic) safer. Casting a specific effect using wild magic and a focus may result in that new magical effect inhabiting the focus and becoming a spell. The player and referee may work together to create a new spell. 

Examples: 

- pearlescent orb 2 md, 2,000 coins
- ruby wand 3 md, 6,000 coins
- yew staff 1 md, 1,000 coins
- ash staff 1 md, 1,000 coins
