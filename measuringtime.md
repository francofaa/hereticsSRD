# Measuring Time

Exploration eats up a lot of in-game time and time eats up a lot of resources. Therefore, strict time records must be kept. 

The referee should pay attention to the resources consumed by the party, such as [food, water, light,](Items) and [magical effects](Magic).

In-game time is measured with special units in addition to common ones: 

- [Watches](wildernessexploration): 4 hours. There are 6 watches per day. Watches are used to measure overland travel and wilderness exploration.
- [Turns](dungeonex): 10 minutes. There are 6 turns per hour. Turns are used to measure dungeon exploration.
- [Rounds](combatrounds): 10 seconds. There are 6 rounds per minute. Rounds are used to measure combat encounters.
