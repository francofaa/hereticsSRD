# Other Species 

The heretics are assumed to be human; however, if the referee allows other non-human species in the game, the player may replace or supplement a background with abilities from their species. Other traits can be created in cooperation with the referee. The referee has final say if the species are appropriate to the setting: 

- **Stone cunning**: You gain tremor sense for 1 dungeon turn per level once per day

- **Beast-speaker**: You can speak to and understand animals
- **Darkvision**: You can see in starlight and moonlight as easily as daylight
- **Monstrous**: You have an unarmed attack that inflicts 1d6 damage
- **Smallfolk**: You have advantage on checks to avoid capture or detection
- **Hardy**: You have advantage on checks against poison
- **Seafolk**: You have a swim speed and can breathe underwater
- **Tracker**: Your keen sense of smell allows you to track creatures up to 12 miles away
