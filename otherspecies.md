# Other Species

The characters are assumed to be human; however, if the referee allows other non-human species in the game, the player may replace one of the background traits with abilities from their species. Other traits can be created in cooperation with the referee. The referee has final say if the species are appropriate to the setting: 

- **Stone cunning**: You gain tremor sense for *L* x 10 minutes once per day
- **Hearth born**: You are immune to fire and weak to cold
- **Burrower**: You can dig superhumanly fast
- **Spiderclimb**: Your hands and feet stick to walls
- **Mimic**: You can imitate any voice you've heard within the last 24 hours
- **Beast-speaker**: You can speak to and understand animals
- **Darkvision**: You can see in starlight and moonlight as easily as daylight
- **Monstrous**: You have an unarmed attack that inflicts 1d6 damage.
