# Traveling

Days are split up into 6 watches (about 3 in the day and 3 in the night), each 4 hours long. 

Characters move 6 miles per watch (4 hours).

Movement is halved through difficult terrain, in darkness, and in bad weather. Movement is doubled when riding a mount or going solely by road. 

## Forced March
Traveling longer than 3 watches (12 hours) requires a +str save of DC 15 per additional watch or suffer 1 point of direct damage (to flesh). 

## Navigation
Navigator determines direction and navigates. The referee rolls that character's +int as necessary (determined by table below). If the characters have an accurate map, this is also not necessary:

| Navigation                                                     | DC       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Road, open sea with land in sight                              | No check |
| Grassland, coast, plains, farmland                             | 5        |
| Arctic, desert, hills, open sea with clear skies               | 10       |
| Forest, jungle, swamp, mountains, open sea with overcast skies | 15       |
| Any region with white-out precipitation                        | +3       |

### Failed Navigation
On a failed navigation check, the referee should roll 1d10 in secret. 

| d10  | Direction               |
| ---- | ----------------------- |
| 1-4  | veered into left hex    |
| 5-6  | arrived in intended hex |
| 7-10 | veered into right hex   |
