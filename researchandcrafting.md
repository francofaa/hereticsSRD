# Research and Crafting

Research and crafting can be done during and across [downtime cycles](downtimecycle). 

## Magical Research

Inventing spells is dangerous. When working to invent a spell, spend 1,000 coins in research activities and resources, spend a week in time, acquire an object to house the spell, and roll +int against a DC 20. On a success, you create the spell with the referee and must cast it once using all of your magic dice. 

On a fail, roll all of your magic dice and make a +warded defense save against your int defense. On a success, any dooms and mishaps are negated. On a failure, they are not. 

You may try to invent the spell again during another [downtime cycle](downtimecycle)

## Brewing and Crafting

Inventing potions is dangerous. When working to invent a potion, spend 1,000 coins in research activities and resources, spend a week in time, and roll +int against a DC 20. On a success, you gain potions 5/5. On a failure, your brewing goes wrong and you suffer a mishap, adjudicated by the referee. 

You may try to brew the potion again during another [downtime cycle](downtimecycle)
