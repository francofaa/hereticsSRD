# Return Journey 

Sometimes there is insufficient time to escape a dungeon or the wilderness to a safe location during a session. When it is necessary that a party be back in civilization or back at a camp, as may be during a Western Marches campaign, the characters may roll to return to a safe camp. 

The referee determines whether this is a dangerous or arduous journey.

DC = 10 + hour of travel, maximum of DC 20

On a success, the characters return to camp. 

On a failure, the characters pay a cost: 

- Dangerous: 1d6 damage is inflicted for every 1 under the DC
- Arduous: lose 1 load of equipment per 1 under the DC

If a character is reduced to 0 flesh, they **die** or are left unconscious, suffering all of the effects of being reduced to 0. The referee picks what load is dropped, starting with less valuable and less secure items, and working up to weapons, armor, spells, and magical items.
