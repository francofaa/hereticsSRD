# Robberies and Heists

The characters may wish to commit a robbery or perform a heist to fund themselves. This procedure may be used if this heist or robbery is not intended to be part of the gameplay. This procedure is intended to be used during a [downtime cycle](downtimecycle). 

If the heist or robbery should be part of the normal gameplay, the downtime cycle should be resolved and normal gameplay time commence with the planning of the heist or robbery. 

## Planning and Execution

Every character that contributes in the scheme adds +1 to the +int roll by the mastermind of the scheme. Any character that contributes to the scheme should describe how and may not perform any other action: They are considered to be taking part in the scheme. 

The mastermind should declare whether violence will be used. If violence is used, they receive a +1 to their roll.

The mastermind should declare whether illicit substances or materials will be used and which ones. If illicit substances or materials are used, they receive a +1 to their roll.

| 4    | Vault       | A well-defended establishment or home | L x d20 x 100 | 20  |

When violence and/or illicit materials or substances are used, the roll is considered to be modified for purposes of determining the outcome:

When there is an active investigation, the participants in a robbery or heist must lay low (meaning they may not perform free actions, actions, or conspicuous consumption) in the place where the crime was committed for a number of downtime cycles determined by the following table: 

| Number of Downtime Cycles | Result            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 1                         | Successful Escape |
| 1d4 x rank                | Left witnesses    |
| 1d8 x rank                | Left evidence     |
| 1d12 x rank               | Left a corpse     |
