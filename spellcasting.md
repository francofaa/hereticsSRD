# Spell Casting

Magic is weird and dangerous. Everything magical is alive. Magical items exist but spells are also themselves alive as written or inscribed words on objects. Magical wards can be used to protect against other magical effects and attacks. [Medicinals](Medicinals) (herbal magic) take the place of many abilities and spells traditionally associated with healer classes in class-based systems. 

To cast spells, mana dice are used, at times resulting in chaotic effects. Spells in the system are level-less.

Spells must be cast holding the item the spell is inscribed on in two hands, unless wielding a focus in another hand. When casting a spell, roll up to your maximum **mana dice**. You may roll fewer than you have. A +int attack roll may also be required. 

Spells live as inscribed words and diagrams upon artifacts, spellbooks, relics, tablets, and mundane items. Spells take up 1 inventory slot. Even if copied into a single spellbook, each spell takes up 1 inventory slot. 

## Spell Tags
- **Line of sight.** Unless otherwise specified by the spell, the spell requires line of sight on the target
- **D:** Duration. Spells with ongoing effects will be denoted as such. This is also where concentration will be denoted. 
- **R:** Range of spells, as a distance.
- **T:** The target(s) of the spell. 
- **\[dice\]** means the number of mana dice rolled. 
- **\[sum\]** means the sum of the mana dice rolled. 
- **Attack.** This refers to whether a spell requires a spell attack. This requires a d20+int attack against the target's warded defense.
- **Save.** This refers to whether a spell requires a save from the target and specifies the ability. For +wil saves, the target uses their warded defense bonus instead. The DC is always equal to the caster's intelligence defense. 
- **Concentration**. Some spells require concentration to maintain. If a spellcaster is attacked or performs an action other than maintaining concentration on the spell, the spell's effect ends. 

## Mana Dice
Mana dice are a pool of d6 equal to your +wil bonus. Spells' features may depend on the number of dice rolled and the sum, or both, or neither. Regardless, the dice must be rolled.

Mana dice are rolled in conjunction with spell attack dice, when applicable. Roll them all at once because even if the attack fails or only inflicts half damage or a weakened effect on the target, the results will still have a material impact.

### Expending and Recovering Mana Dice
On a 1-3, the mana die returns to your pool. On a 4-6, the caster must have a long rest for the mana dice to return at dawn.

#### Wards as Mana Dice
Wards can also be used to contribute mana dice (1 for 1) and are destroyed on a roll of 4-6 and cannot be recovered. The ward is unaffected on a 1-3. When using a ward as a mana die, separate the roll by using a different color die or rolling it first or last, separately from the other dice. 

#### Mana Dice from Focuses

Focuses can grant mana dice as well. The dice from a focus is expended upon use and does not return until dawn. Some focuses may have additional effects. 

### Counterspelling with Mana Dice

To negate the effects of a spell, a character may attempt to counterspell by rolling mana dice. Make a spell attack +int against the target's warded defense. On a success, the spell is negated. This is performed as a reaction to a spell as it is cast or on an ongoing effect of a spell. 

### Mishaps and Dooms
If the caster rolls **doubles** on their dice, a magical mishap occurs with the spell. 

If the caster rolls **triples** on their dice, they receive 1 doom. 

Mishaps may be avoided by destroying a **ward.** Dooms may be avoided by destroying **three wards**.

| 3rd | The spell escapes the object and you are trapped in the object now. You become a spell. |

### Coven Casting
With a magical ritual and symbols (like string tied around fingers, rings, tattoos, etc), characters may be bound together and **share** mana dice in a single pool. 

## Wild Magic
When casting magic, never be your main battery. Always use a buffer like a spellbook, artifact, focus, etc. 

But if you must: You may use mana dice as a way to tap into the wild magic of the world. Describe an effect and choose a target, and the referee should adjudicate the results, which will be hazardous and may not work as expected, and mishaps and dooms will still apply as well and may become even worse.
