# Spell Casting

Magic is weird and dangerous. Everything magical is alive. Magical items exist but spells are also themselves alive as written or inscribed words on objects.  

Spells live as inscribed words and diagrams upon artifacts, spellbooks, relics, tablets, and mundane items. Spells take up 1 inventory slot. Even if copied into a single spellbook, each spell takes up 1 inventory slot. 

## Procedure

The heretic must be holding the item the spell is inscribed on in two hands, unless wielding a focus in another hand. When casting a spell, roll up to your maximum **magic dice**. You may roll fewer than you have. 

Depending on the spell, a +int attack roll may also be required.


## Spell Tags
- **Line of sight.** Unless otherwise specified by the spell, the spell requires line of sight on the target
- **D:** Duration. Spells with ongoing effects will be denoted as such. This is also where concentration will be denoted. 
- **R:** Range of spells, as a distance.
- **T:** The target(s) of the spell. 
- **dice** means the number of magic dice rolled. 
- **sum** means the sum of the magic dice rolled. 
- **Attack.** This refers to whether a spell requires a spell attack. This requires a d20+int attack against the target's warded defense.
- **Save.** This refers to whether a spell requires a save from the target and specifies the ability. For +wil saves, the target uses their warded defense bonus instead. The DC is always equal to the caster's intelligence defense. 
- **Concentration**. Some spells require concentration to maintain. If a spellcaster is attacked or performs an action other than maintaining concentration on the spell, the spell's effect ends. 

## Magic Dice
Magic dice are a pool of d6 equal to your +wil bonus. Spells' features may depend on the number of dice rolled and the sum, or both, or neither. Regardless, the dice must be rolled.

Magic dice are rolled in conjunction with spell attack dice, when applicable. Roll them all at once because even if the attack fails or only inflicts half damage or a weakened effect on the target, the results will still have a material impact.

### Expending and Recovering Magic Dice
On a 1, 2, or 3, the magic die returns to your pool. On a 4, 5, or 6, the caster must have a long rest for the magic dice to return at dawn.

### Magic Dice from Focuses

Focuses can grant magic dice. The dice from a focus is expended upon use and does not return until dawn. Some focuses may have additional effects. 

### Counterspelling with Magic Dice

To negate the effects of a spell, a character may attempt to counterspell by burning magic dice. Remove magic dice up to your max from your pool until dawn. Make a spell attack +int plus the number of magic dice burned against the target's warded defense. On a success, the spell is negated. This is performed as a reaction to a spell as it is cast or on an ongoing effect of a spell.

### Coven Casting
With a magical ritual and symbols (like string tied around fingers, rings, tattoos, etc), heretics may be bound together and **share** magic dice in a single pool. Heretics that follow different sources cannot coven cast together.

## Mishaps and Dooms

If the caster rolls **doubles** on their magic dice, a magical mishap occurs with the spell behaving as written. If multiple doubles are rolled, the highest number takes precedence.

If the caster rolls **triples** on their magic dice, they receive 1 doom. The spell occurs as written. 

If four dice are the same, it counts as a triple. If five or more dice are the same, it counts as a triple and a double (mishap). 

Wards may also be broken to nullify mishaps and dooms. A +1 wdef ward is required to nullify a mishap. To nullify a doom, wards providing a cumulative +wdef of +3 must be destroyed. 

The party's mishaps and doom tables are based on their [Source](Source). Dooms are progressive and can be removed with quests. 


## Wild Magic
When casting magic, never be your main battery. Always use a buffer like a spellbook, artifact, focus, etc. 

But if you must: You may use magic dice as a way to tap into the wild magic of the world. Describe an effect and choose a target, and the referee should adjudicate the results, which will be hazardous and may not work as expected, and mishaps and dooms will still apply as well and may become even worse.
