# Wilderness Exploration

## Watches
Days are split up into 6 watches (about 3 in the day and 3 in the night), each 4 hours long. 

A navigator should be declared. 

## Activities
Characters can spend a full watch in a 30 square mile area (6 mile hex) in order to forage or explore. 

### Exploring 
Players spending time exploring and find points of interest that wouldn't be identified while traveling right through a hex. If there are multiple points of interest, randomly determine one. 

### Foraging  
Characters may forage and hunt for food. This requires a +int check depending on the environment. Such a check may also be impossible in certain environments. 

| Foraging                                    | DC  |
| ------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Abundant food and water sources             | 10  |
| Limited food and water sources              | 15  |
| Very little, if any, water and food sources | 20  |

A successful roll yields 1d6 worth of food. Food is maximum 2 per slot. A character may also forage for [Supply](Supply) once per day, up to a number equal to their intelligence defense.

#### Foraging for Components

Rather than hunting for food, characters may search for components for [Medicinals](Medicinals). Search as above, but on a success, roll 1d12 for each point of intelligence bonus. Roll 1d4 for each, receiving that amount. 

All components are a maximum of 5 per slot.
